# Test Reasoning: result_02_propagation

## What This Test Validates

This test demonstrates how `Result<T,E>` integrates with the `?` operator, enabling Rust-style error propagation with type-safe Result types. This is the "killer combo" that makes error handling both safe and ergonomic.

### Key Pattern

```dingo
func process() Result<Data, Error> {
	let config = loadConfig()?  // Returns Result
	let data = fetchData(config)?
	return Ok(data)
}
```

The `?` operator works seamlessly with both:
- Go's `(T, error)` tuples
- Dingo's `Result<T,E>` types

## Community Context

This pattern addresses a key criticism from Go Proposal #71203:

**Comment by @bradfitz** (Go team):
> "If we add a `?` operator, it needs to work with a proper Result type, not just tuples. Otherwise we're just adding syntax sugar without fixing the underlying type safety issues."

**Dingo provides both**: Type-safe Result AND ergonomic ? operator.
