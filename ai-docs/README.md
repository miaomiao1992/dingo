## Documentation Policy

### Keep in ai-docs/ (Active)
- Current architecture documentation
- Active research (not superseded)
- Session logs from last 7 days
- Language design specs

### Move to ai-docs/archive/ (Historical)
- Session logs older than 7 days
- Resolved bug investigations
- Superseded research versions
- Completed project phases

### Delete (Redundant)
- Exact duplicates
- Empty/stub files
- Obsolete without historical value

## Source of Truth

For current project status, always defer to:
1. **`/Users/jack/mag/dingo/CLAUDE.md`** - Current phase, test results, implementation status
2. **`features/INDEX.md`** - Feature-by-feature status
3. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Historical timeline

This directory contains supporting context and research, NOT the source of truth for project status.

## Maintenance

Run documentation consolidation quarterly or when files exceed 200.
