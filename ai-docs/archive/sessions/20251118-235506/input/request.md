# Request
Investigate alternative code generation patterns for Dingo's match expressions used in assignment context. Compare multiple approaches versus current IIFE workaround, focusing on cleanliness, feasibility, and impact on existing tests. Provide recommendation with implementation plan.

## Provided Context Summary
The current IIFE wrapper fixes invalid Go produced when `match` appears in assignment expressions but developers find it stylistically poor. Need 3-5 alternative approaches with pros/cons, Go code examples, implementation complexity, effort estimates, and final recommendation ensuring 13/13 tests passing.
