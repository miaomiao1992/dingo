Option B Implementation: SUCCESS

Status: Comment pollution ELIMINATED ✅
Files: 2 modified (plugin.go, generator.go)
Tests: Pattern matching shows clean injected types + preserved user comments

Key Findings:
1. Injected types section: ZERO DINGO comments (verified)
2. User code section: ALL DINGO comments preserved (verified)
3. Physical AST separation works as designed
4. Pre-existing bug found: pattern match assignment syntax (not caused by Option B)

Next Steps:
- Update golden test files to match new output format
- Fix pre-existing pattern match assignment bug separately
- Mark comment pollution issue as RESOLVED
