DINGO_MATCH_START Bug Fix Summary

Status: PARTIAL FIX APPLIED
Root Cause: Pattern match plugin transforms switch → if without preserving DINGO comments

What I Fixed:
- Restored // DINGO_MATCH_START comment in generateSwitch() (line 432)
- Comment now appears BEFORE temp variable (__match_N := scrutinee)
- Maintains Variable Hoisting pattern

What Still Needs Fixing:
- PatternMatchPlugin.transformMatchExpression (line 832-865) transforms switch → if
- This transformation DISCARDS all DINGO comments
- Result: Comments appear at wrong line numbers (in Option type declarations)
- Need to modify PatternMatchPlugin to preserve comments during transformation

Test Status: STILL FAILING
- pattern_match_01_simple expects switch-based output with DINGO comments
- Current output has if-based code WITHOUT DINGO comments (comments corrupted)
- Fix applied helps switch-based output, but doesn't fix if-based transformation

Next Steps:
1. Modify PatternMatchPlugin to extract and preserve DINGO comments
2. Update golden file to expect if-based output with comments
3. OR: Disable PatternMatchPlugin for Rust syntax (keep switch-based)
