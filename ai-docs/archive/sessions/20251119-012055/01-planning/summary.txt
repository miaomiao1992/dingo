Architecture Plan Complete

Status: Success - Comprehensive plan ready for review
Approach: Implement 4 missing context type helpers (Task 1), then enhance pattern match scrutinee detection with go/types (Task 2), add Err() context inference (Task 3), and complete guard validation (Task 4) - all leverage existing infrastructure (parent map, go/types integration already in place)
Complexity: Medium - Implementation is straightforward (~400 lines total), but requires careful integration with existing type inference service and comprehensive testing
Key Decisions: (1) Sequential implementation order (1→2→3→4) minimizes risk and allows thorough testing, (2) go/types as primary with parseTypeExpr() fallback ensures robustness, (3) Guard validation will be strict to catch errors early
Timeline: 5-8 days total (2-3 days Task 1, 1 day Task 2, 1-2 days Task 3, 1-2 days Task 4)
