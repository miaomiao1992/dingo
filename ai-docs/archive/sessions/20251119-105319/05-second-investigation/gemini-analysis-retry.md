Okay, I have the *exact* current content of `pkg/plugin/builtin/type_inference.go`. I will now construct the complete `new_string` for the entire file content, incorporating all the discussed changes to `InferType` and adding `makeNamedType`. Then I will use `Write` to overwrite the file.

This approach should finally resolve the persistent editing issues.
