REASON: Critical bugs in pattern matching transformation prevent compilation

BLOCKING ISSUES:

1. File 06 (guards_nested): Preprocessor bug - parse errors on line 98 (file only has 54 lines)
   - Likely: match expression duplication in preprocessor

2. Files 07-08 (guards_complex, guards_edge_cases): Field name generation bug
   - Generated: __match_0.request_get_0 (incorrect)
   - Should be: __match_0.Request_Get_0 (capitalized variant name)
   - Also: Duplicate case statements and unused string literals

3. Files 09-12 (tuple_*): Multiple critical issues
   - Missing: ResultTagOk, ResultTagErr constants (undefined)
   - Issue: Variable hoisting not working (x, y, z undefined in expressions)
   - Issue: Multiple default cases generated (should be only one)

NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:

Priority 1: Fix variable hoisting in tuple pattern transformation
Priority 2: Fix tag constant naming (ResultTagOk vs ResultTag_Ok)
Priority 3: Fix field name generation in guard patterns (capitalize variant names)
Priority 4: Fix preprocessor duplication bug in file 06
Priority 5: Fix duplicate case generation and unused literals

Cannot proceed with golden file generation until these bugs are fixed.
