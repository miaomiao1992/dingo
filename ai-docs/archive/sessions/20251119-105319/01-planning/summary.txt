Implementation plan complete. 3-batch strategy: Batch 1 creates 7 missing golden files + fixes Result naming (parallel, 1-2h), Batch 2 fixes error propagation bug (sequential, 2-3h), Batch 3 regenerates outdated golden files (sequential, 2-3h). Expected outcome: 261 → 265-267 tests passing (98-100%) in 5-8 hours. Critical decision needed: ResultTagOk (camelCase, recommended) vs ResultTag_Ok (underscore). Deferred: None inference enhancement (affects 1 test, requires 4-6h).
