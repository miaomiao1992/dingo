Problem: Determine the most idiomatic Go naming convention for generated enum variants in Dingo.

We need to evaluate different naming schemes (Option A: Current - Underscore, Option B: Pure CamelCase, Option C: Namespaced, Option D: All Lowercase) based on Go Idiomaticity, Clarity, Collision Avoidance, Pattern Matching Syntax compatibility, Type Safety, and Familiarity to Rust/Swift/TypeScript users.

Consider the provided Go examples and the Dingo design principles. Answer the following questions:
1. Which naming convention (A, B, C, or D) is most Go-idiomatic?
2. Are there better alternatives not listed above?
3. What are the trade-offs of each approach?
4. How do other Go libraries handle discriminated unions / sum types?
5. What would Go developers expect when using Dingo-generated code?
6. Does the underscore convention have any benefits that outweigh non-idiomaticity?
