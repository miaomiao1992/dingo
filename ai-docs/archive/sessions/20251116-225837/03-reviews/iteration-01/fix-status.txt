ALL_FIXED

All 3 CRITICAL bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. IIFE Type Inference - Implemented basic type inference from literals and binary expressions
2. Tuple Variants Backing Fields - Added synthetic field generation for unnamed tuple fields
3. Debug Mode Variable - Added dingoDebug variable emission when debug mode is enabled

Code compiles successfully. Ready for golden test verification.
