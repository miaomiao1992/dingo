  - Added session reference: 20251118-114514

**Lines modified**: ~30 lines updated

### 3. `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Status**: No changes needed
- Architecture document already explains two-stage transpilation
- Type inference architecture covered in existing "Future Architecture" section
- IIFE pattern is an implementation detail, doesn't change architecture
- Document remains accurate for Phase 3

**Rationale**: ARCHITECTURE.md focuses on overall system design, not implementation details. Fix A4/A5 are plugin enhancements that fit within existing architecture.
