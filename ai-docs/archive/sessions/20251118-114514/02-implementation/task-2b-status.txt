SUCCESS

All requirements completed:
- Fix A5: Enhanced type inference using TypeInferenceService ✅
- Fix A4: Literal handling with IIFE pattern ✅
- Type-context-aware None constant (complex feature) ✅
- Unit tests: 17/17 passing ✅
- Golden test created: option_02_literals.dingo ✅
- Documentation complete ✅

Limitations documented:
- InferTypeFromContext() is placeholder (requires AST parent tracking)
- None constant limited to contexts where go/types can infer type
- Desanitization incomplete for complex types (map, array, function)

Helper methods deferred to Batch 3 as planned.
