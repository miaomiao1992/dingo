Phase 3 Implementation Plan Summary

Architecture plan complete for fixing literal handling (A4), enhancing type inference with go/types (A5), and implementing Option<T> type. Recommended execution order: (1) Fix A5 - go/types integration for accurate type inference, eliminating interface{} fallbacks; (2) Fix A4 - IIFE pattern for non-addressable expressions in constructors; (3) Option<T> - apply both fixes to complete implementation. Estimated effort: 8-16 hours over 1-2 days, with clear rollback plans for each component and 8 clarifying questions documented in gaps.json.
