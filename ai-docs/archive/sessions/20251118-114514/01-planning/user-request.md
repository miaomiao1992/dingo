# User Request: Proceed to Phase 3

## Context
Phase 2.16 is complete with the following known limitations that need to be addressed in Phase 3:

**Fix A4: Literal Handling**
- Problem: `Ok(42)` generates `&42` which is invalid Go
- Solution: Need to generate temporary variables for literal values before taking addresses

**Fix A5: Enhanced Type Inference**
- Problem: Type inference sometimes falls back to `interface{}`
- Solution: Integrate `go/types` for proper type inference in Result<T,E> contexts

**New Feature: Option<T> Type**
- Implement Option<T> type similar to Result<T,E>
- Support Some()/None() constructors
- Provide helper methods (IsSome, IsNone, Unwrap, etc.)

## Current State
- ✅ Two-stage transpilation pipeline working (preprocessor + go/parser)
- ✅ Enum preprocessor functional
- ✅ Plugin pipeline (Discovery → Transform → Inject)
- ✅ Result<T,E> foundation with Ok()/Err() working (with known limitations)
- ✅ 48/48 preprocessor tests passing
- ⚠️ 31/39 builtin plugin tests passing (8 deferred to Phase 3)
- ⚠️ 1/3 parser tests passing (2 deferred - lambda/safe-nav)

## Expected Deliverables
1. Fix A4 implementation - literal value handling
2. Fix A5 implementation - go/types integration for type inference
3. Option<T> type implementation with full feature parity to Result<T,E>
4. Updated test suite with all deferred tests passing
5. Golden tests for Option<T> type
6. Documentation updates (CHANGELOG.md)

## Success Criteria
- All 39 builtin plugin tests passing
- Golden tests for literals in Result constructors
- Golden tests for Option<T> type
- End-to-end verification: .dingo → .go → compile → run
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Timeline
Target: 1-2 day development session
