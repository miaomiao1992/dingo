# Implementation Notes - Session 20251117-181304

## Executive Summary

This session implemented the foundation for the Dingo migration to a preprocessor-based architecture. **Phase 2.1 is complete** with a working error propagation preprocessor. The full migration remains substantial work requiring multiple additional sessions as originally estimated.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Preprocessor-First Strategy

**Decision**: Do full transformation in preprocessor, not placeholder-based approach

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation - avoid complex AST manipulation
- Better error messages - source maps map original lines to expanded lines
- Proven pattern - TypeScript, CoffeeScript use similar approaches
- Easier to debug - intermediate Go code is valid and inspectable

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex preprocessing logic
- Harder to reuse transformation logic
- BUT: Simpler overall system, easier to maintain

### 2. Line-Based Processing

**Approach**: Process input line-by-line, expand Dingo syntax to Go

**Benefits**:
- Preserves line structure for better debugging
- Source maps are straightforward
- Incremental processing - can handle large files
- Clear transformation boundaries

**Limitations**:
- Multi-line constructs require special handling
- Must carefully track indentation
- Complex expressions spanning lines need buffering

### 3. Feature Detection via Regex

**Current Implementation**:
```go
assignPattern := regexp.MustCompile(`^\s*(let|var)\s+(\w+)\s*=\s*(.+)\?\s*$`)
returnPattern := regexp.MustCompile(`^\s*return\s+(.+)\?\s*$`)
```

**Pros**:
- Fast, simple detection
- Works for 80% of cases

**Cons**:
- Fragile for complex expressions
- Doesn't handle nested structures well

**Future Improvement**:
- Use simple tokenizer for expression boundary detection
- Handle edge cases: `func(args)?`, `obj.Method()?`, `arr[i]?`

## Feature-Specific Notes

### Error Propagation (`?` operator)

**Status**: Phase 2.1 COMPLETE

**Implementation**:
- Detects `expr?` pattern in assignment or return context
- Expands to:
  ```go
  __tmpN, __errN := expr
  if __errN != nil {
      return zeroValue, __errN
  }
  ```
- Handles both `let x = expr?` and `return expr?` forms

**Known Limitations**:
1. **Zero values**: Currently hardcoded (nil, 0)
   - Solution: Parse function signature to determine correct zero values
   - Requires AST analysis or function context tracking

2. **Multiple ? in expression**: `let x = foo()? + bar()?`
   - Not yet handled - needs expression parsing
   - Workaround: Require separate statements

3. **Complex expressions**: `let x = obj.Method(arg1, arg2)?`
   - Regex may fail to detect expression boundaries
   - Need better expression parser

**Testing**:
- Unit tests pass for basic cases
- Golden tests not yet wired up (require CLI integration)

### Lambdas (`|x| expr`)

**Status**: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Planned Approach**:
1. Preprocessor: Detect `|params| body` pattern
2. Generate placeholder with captured params
3. Transformer: Use go/types for type inference
4. Replace with properly-typed func literal

**Challenges**:
- Type inference requires full type-checking pass
- Closure variable capture needs analysis
- Multi-line lambda bodies

**Reference**: TypeScript lambda implementation

### Sum Types (`enum`)

**Status**: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Planned Approach**:
1. Detect `enum Name { Variant1, Variant2(Type), ... }`
2. Generate full tagged union implementation:
   ```go
   type Name struct { tag string; variant1_0 *Type; ... }
   func Name_Variant1(...) Name { ... }
   func (n Name) IsVariant1() bool { ... }
   ```

**Can Reuse**: Old plugin/sum_types.go logic (926 lines)

**Simplification**: Do full expansion in preprocessor, no transformer needed

### Pattern Matching (`match`)

**Status**: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Planned Approach**:
1. Detect `match expr { Pattern1 => handler1, ... }`
2. Generate switch statement with pattern extraction
3. Handle exhaustiveness checking

**Complexity**: HIGH - requires pattern parsing and validation

## Architectural Insights

### Why Preprocessor-Based Works

1. **Dingo is a superset of Go**
   - Most Dingo code is already valid Go
   - Only special syntax needs transformation
   - Preprocessing is minimal, targeted

2. **Transformations are local**
   - `?` operator transforms to a few lines of code
   - Doesn't affect surrounding code structure
   - Easy to reason about and test

3. **Go's tooling still works**
   - After preprocessing, it's standard Go
   - gofmt, gopls, go/types all work
   - Debugging maps back via source maps

### Comparison to Plugin Architecture

**Old (Plugin-Based)**:
- Parse .dingo → Custom AST
- Walk AST, apply transformations
- Generate Go code
- Complex, many moving parts
- Hard to debug failures

**New (Preprocessor-Based)**:
- Preprocess .dingo → valid Go
- Parse Go → go/ast
- Optional AST transformations (for complex features)
- Generate final Go code
- Simpler, fewer layers
- Intermediate output is valid Go

**Winner**: Preprocessor-based for maintainability and simplicity

## Deviations from Plan

### Original Plan
- Complete all phases (2-7) in one session
- Estimated 16-24 hours

### Reality
- Completed Phase 2.1 only
- ~4 hours invested

### Reason for Deviation
1. **Underestimated integration complexity**
   - CLI needs complete rewrite
   - Tests need new harness
   - Old plugin system deeply embedded

2. **Discovered simpler architecture**
   - Spent time refactoring to preprocessor-first
   - Better long-term, but took longer upfront

3. **Realistic scope**
   - Original estimate of 16-24 hours was accurate
   - Not feasible in single session
   - Incremental approach is correct

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- Preprocessor test suite: 0.494s for basic tests
- Line-by-line processing: O(n) in lines of code
- Regex matching: O(m) in line length

**Bottlenecks**:
- Regex compilation (should cache)
- String concatenation in expansion (use strings.Builder)
- Multiple passes over same content

**Optimizations** (deferred):
- Compile regexes once, reuse
- Single-pass processing where possible
- Buffer expansion strings efficiently

**Target**: < 100ms for typical file (as per plan)
**Current**: Not yet measured, likely acceptable

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Created pkg/preprocessor/preprocessor_test.go
- Tests basic error propagation
- Fast, isolated, easy to debug

**Coverage**: Need to add:
- Edge cases (nested expressions, multiline)
- Error cases (malformed syntax)
- Multiple features in same file

### Integration Tests
- Golden tests exist but use old architecture
- Need new test harness using preprocessor pipeline
- Compare .dingo → preprocessor → parser → generator → .go

**Priority**: HIGH - need this to validate transformations

### End-to-End Tests
- CLI tests (dingo build file.dingo)
- Verify generated Go compiles
- Verify program runs correctly

**Priority**: MEDIUM - can validate manually for now

## Error Handling

### Error Position Mapping
- Source maps track original → generated line/column
- go/parser errors need to be mapped back
- Critical for good developer experience

**Current State**: Infrastructure exists, not yet tested

**TODO**:
- Test error reporting with malformed .dingo
- Verify errors point to correct original positions
- Ensure helpful error messages

### Failure Modes

1. **Preprocessing fails**: Syntax error, unrecognized pattern
   - Should show original source position
   - Helpful message ("expected expression before `?`")

2. **Go parsing fails**: Generated Go is invalid
   - Map position back to .dingo
   - Show both original and generated code
   - Debug mode: save preprocessed .go for inspection

3. **Type errors**: go/types reports error
   - Map to original position
   - May be confusing (refers to generated constructs)
   - Consider custom error messages for Dingo constructs

## Code Quality

### What's Good
- Clean separation of concerns
- Well-documented functions
- Test coverage for basics
- Simple, readable implementation

### What Needs Improvement
- Error handling is basic (return early pattern)
- Edge cases not fully covered
- Performance not optimized
- Complex regex needs validation

### Technical Debt
- Regex-based parsing is fragile
- Should use tokenizer for robustness
- Zero value generation is hardcoded
- Source map generation not fully tested

**Priority**: Address when features are working end-to-end

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start simple, iterate**
   - Preprocessor-first was right call
   - Could have started here earlier

2. **Test incrementally**
   - Unit tests gave confidence
   - Caught bugs early

3. **Scope carefully**
   - 16-24 hour estimate was accurate
   - One session can't do it all

4. **Integration is hard**
   - Wiring up new architecture takes time
   - Old code deeply coupled
   - Refactoring is necessary

5. **Documentation matters**
   - These notes will help future sessions
   - Plan.md was invaluable guide
   - Keep context up to date

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Immediate Priorities (Session 2)

1. **Complete error propagation** (2-3 hours)
   - Handle multiple ? in one function
   - Fix complex expression parsing
   - Wire up golden tests

2. **Start lambdas** (1-2 hours)
   - Implement basic lambda preprocessor
   - Test simple cases
   - Defer type inference to Session 3
