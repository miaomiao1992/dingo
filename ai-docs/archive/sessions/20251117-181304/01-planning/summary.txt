Complete implementation plan for Dingo migration Phases 2-7 created. Infrastructure from Phase 0-1 is ready (source maps, preprocessor framework, go/parser wrapper, transformer framework). Plan details 10 phases across 46 golden tests: error propagation (8), lambdas (4), sum types (5), pattern matching (4), operators (9), Result/Option (9), tuples (3), CLI integration, and documentation. Estimated timeline: 16-32 hours (realistic: 24 hours) across 6-8 sessions. Each phase has clear deliverables, test criteria, and implementation strategy. No blocking questions - ready to proceed with Phase 2 (error propagation).
