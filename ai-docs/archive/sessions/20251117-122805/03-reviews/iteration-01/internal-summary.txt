STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 3
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 8

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Pipeline uses reflection for TypeInferenceService calls (performance, type safety)
2. Parser-generated AST causes go/types crashes (golden tests blocked)
3. Missing error handling in type inference (silent failures)

IMPORTANT ISSUES:
1. Err() type inference incomplete (generates invalid Result_T_error)
2. Missing unit tests for error_propagation plugin
3. Type name collision risk in sanitization
4. Potential reinvention of go/types functionality
5. Comprehensive type inference tests needed
6. Result/Option plugins missing tests
7. Code duplication in typeToString/sanitizeTypeName
8. Unsafe type assertion patterns

RECOMMENDATION:
Address 3 critical issues before merge (estimated 6-10 hours).
Code quality is generally good, architecture is sound, issues are fixable.

STRENGTHS:
- Clean architecture with plugin system
- Good use of Go idioms and AST manipulation
- 100% plugin test pass rate
- Proper dependency injection patterns
- Configuration system well-designed

ESTIMATED FIX TIME:
- Critical: 8-12 hours
- Important: 20-30 hours
- Total: 28-42 hours for full resolution
