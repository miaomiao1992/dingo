Proposed 4-phase sequential approach to address priority tasks: (1) Test Stabilization - fix 8 failing tests to achieve 100% pass rate baseline in 2-3 hours, (2) Type Inference Integration - create shared TypeInferenceService in plugin pipeline enabling cross-plugin type awareness and Result/Option detection in 6-8 hours (critical blocker), (3) Result/Option Completion - implement full Result<T,E> and Option<T> types with Go interop auto-wrapping, error propagation integration, and safe navigation fixes in 6-8 hours, (4) Parser Enhancements - add ternary operator, pattern destructuring, map types, and type declaration syntax to unlock 15+/20 golden tests in 2-3 hours. Total estimate: 18-24 hours, unlocking all currently blocked features while maintaining robust plugin architecture and 95%+ test coverage.
