Architecture plan complete. Migration is partially done (Result/Option already use CamelCase) - only custom enum generation in pattern matching needs updating. Primary changes in `rust_match.go` functions: `getTagName()`, `generateBinding()`, `generateTupleBinding()` - simple pattern of removing underscore separators. 4 edge cases require user decisions: multi-field naming strategy, acronym handling, collision resolution, and numeric suffix confirmation. Complete plan with line-by-line changes written to initial-plan.md.
