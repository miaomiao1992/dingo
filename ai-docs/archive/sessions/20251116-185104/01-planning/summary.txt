Phase 1.6 will complete the error propagation operator (?) pipeline by creating a two-pass transformer that discovers Dingo nodes, generates Go early-return patterns with proper zero values, injects statements into the AST with correct parent references, and produces VLQ-encoded source maps for IDE integration. The current parser and plugin foundations are solid, but need a dedicated transformer architecture (pkg/transformer/) with type inference (pkg/types/) to replace the temporary plugin approach and achieve full end-to-end functionality from .dingo source to compilable Go code.
