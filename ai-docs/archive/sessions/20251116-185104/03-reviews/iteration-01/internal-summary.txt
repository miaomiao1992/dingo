STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 3
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 6

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Statement injection does not modify AST correctly - transformations may not appear in output
2. Parent chain traversal limited to immediate parent - nested expressions will fail
3. Zero test coverage - correctness cannot be verified

IMPORTANT ISSUES:
1. Hardcoded "main" package name in type checker
2. Inefficient O(n²) bubble sort in source map generation
3. Incomplete string escaping (missing \r, \f, \b, \v)
4. Named type zero values may be incorrect for function types
5. Global variable race condition in parser (not thread-safe)
6. Memory leak in type inference - types.Info maps never released

RECOMMENDATION:
Do not merge until CRITICAL issues are resolved and minimum test coverage added.
Estimated 5-7 days additional work required.

STRENGTHS:
+ Excellent architectural separation (TypeInference, StatementLifter, ErrorWrapper)
+ Comprehensive type coverage for zero value generation
+ Graceful error handling with degradation
+ Smart reuse of standard libraries (go/types, astutil)
+ Clear documentation and comments

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix statement injection to work with astutil.Apply cursor mechanism
2. Implement full parent chain traversal with parent map
3. Add smoke tests for each component (minimum 20 tests)
4. Verify generated code compiles in integration tests
