Phase 3 connects existing infrastructure to enable Result/Option types by treating them as "blessed enums" that reuse the sum types plugin for transformation and add specialized helper methods (Unwrap, Map, AndThen, etc.). This approach eliminates 500+ lines of duplicate code by leveraging the battle-tested sum types transformation (926 lines, fully tested) and requires only ~350 lines of new code for parser tagging and helper method generation. Estimated timeline is 3-4 days to enable all 9 result_*/option_* golden tests with high confidence due to reusing proven components.
