# Feature Analysis Request

## Objective
Create a comprehensive analysis of ALL Dingo features:
- What's documented in `features/` folder
- What's actually implemented in the codebase
- Test coverage for each feature
- Complexity rating for remaining work

## Requirements
1. Catalog EVERY feature file in `features/` folder
2. Verify actual implementation (not just documentation)
3. Check test coverage (golden tests, unit tests)
4. Compare documentation claims vs reality
5. Rate complexity: Low/Medium/High/Very High

## Output Format
For each feature, provide:
- Feature name
- Status: ✅ Complete / 🟡 Partial / ❌ Not Started
- Implementation files (with line numbers)
- Test files covering it
- Documentation vs Reality gap
- Complexity if not complete
- Notes/blockers
