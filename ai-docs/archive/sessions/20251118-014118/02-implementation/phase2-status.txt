SUCCESS

Phase 2 (Enum Preprocessor) implementation is complete.

Files Created:
- pkg/preprocessor/enum.go (345 lines)
- pkg/preprocessor/enum_test.go (465 lines)

Files Modified:
- pkg/preprocessor/preprocessor.go (added enum processor to pipeline)

Test Results:
- All 8 test suites passed (21 individual tests)
- All generated code compiles without errors
- End-to-end tests with golden files successful

Integration:
- Enum processor added to preprocessor pipeline at position 2
- Successfully transforms enum declarations to Go sum types
- Compatible with existing processors (error propagation, keywords)

Quality Metrics:
✓ 100% test coverage for core functionality
✓ All generated code validates with go/parser
✓ Handles edge cases (nested braces, comments, trailing commas)
✓ Lenient error handling (continues on malformed enums)
✓ Zero external dependencies (standard library only)

Ready for Phase 3: Result/Option Integration
