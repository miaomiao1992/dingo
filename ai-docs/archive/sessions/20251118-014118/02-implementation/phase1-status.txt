SUCCESS

Phase 1 Complete: Golden tests now use preprocessor before parsing.

Key Achievement:
- All tested golden files parse successfully (no parser errors)
- Tests fail on output comparison only (formatting/variable numbering)
- Parser fix objective achieved

Files Modified:
- tests/golden_test.go (added preprocessor integration)

Tests Verified:
- error_prop_01_simple ✅ Parse success
- error_prop_03_expression ✅ Parse success
- error_prop_06_mixed_context ✅ Parse success

Output comparison failures are expected and will be addressed in Phase 2 & 3.
