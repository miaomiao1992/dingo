Phase 3 Final Plan - Executive Summary
==========================================

✅ All user decisions incorporated into final implementation plan

Key Changes from Initial Plan:
- Added Stage 0: Three-mode go_interop configuration (opt-in/auto/disabled)
- None type inference: Compilation error with helpful messages (no fallback to interface{})
- Helper methods: Generate complete API for all Result/Option types
- Lambdas: Confirmed in Phase 4 (separate from Result/Option work)

Timeline: 4-5 weeks (unchanged)
New Code: ~2,450 lines (~350 more than initial for config system)

User Decisions:
1. Go Interop: Three modes via dingo.toml (opt-in default, auto optional, disabled available)
2. None Inference: Error when type unclear (forces explicit types)
3. Helper Methods: Full API generation (simplicity over optimization)
4. Lambdas: Phase 4 (focused approach)

Ready to start implementation with Task 0.1: Configuration System Extension
