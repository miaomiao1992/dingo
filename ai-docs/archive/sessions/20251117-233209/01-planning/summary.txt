Phase 3 (Result/Option Integration) is ready to start: 4-5 week timeline to implement Result<T, E> and Option<T> types as builtin plugins following the proven sum_types architecture. The plan targets 9 golden tests (result_01-05, option_01-04) with comprehensive type inference, helper method generation, pattern matching integration, and optional Go interoperability. Success means Go's #1 pain point (error handling) gets elegant syntax while maintaining zero runtime overhead and full ecosystem compatibility.
