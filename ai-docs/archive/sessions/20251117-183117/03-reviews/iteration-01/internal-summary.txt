STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 4
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 8

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Import detection regex produces false positives - will fail to add required imports
2. Silent error fallbacks hide failures - zero values will be incorrect without visibility
3. Type annotation regex cannot handle qualified types, generics, function types
4. Missing unit tests for all new preprocessor components (448 lines untested)

IMPORTANT ISSUES:
5. Incorrect zero value for custom structs (returns nil instead of Type{})
6. Hardcoded magic strings reduce maintainability
7. Ternary detection too simplistic - false negatives
8. Type annotation processor fails on multi-line function signatures
9. Source map mappings incomplete - only first line mapped
10. Parser stub violates error handling conventions
11. Preprocessor pipeline doesn't compose source maps correctly
12. Plugin stubs use interface{} instead of proper types

MINOR ISSUES: 6 (documentation, dead code, formatting)

STRENGTHS:
- AST-based zero value inference is robust and well-designed
- All 8 golden tests pass successfully
- Clean processor pipeline architecture
- Good separation of concerns

RECOMMENDATION:
Fix critical issues #1-4 before merge. Import detection bug is highest priority as it will break production code. Add comprehensive unit tests to prevent regressions.

RATING: 6.5/10 - Core logic solid, but critical quality issues must be addressed.
