Phase 2.2 completes error propagation by fixing critical bugs (hardcoded zero values, expression parsing failures) and integrating the preprocessor into the CLI pipeline. The plan implements expression parsing with go/scanner, zero value inference from function signatures, error message wrapping with fmt.Errorf, and CLI integration with source maps. All 8 error_prop golden tests will pass with correct, compilable Go output.
