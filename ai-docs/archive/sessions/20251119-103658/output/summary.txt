Phase 5 tooling gaps center on the missing LSP proxy, nondeterministic builds, manual golden-test workflows, and absent editor/installation tooling.
Critical path should tackle sourcemap validation, dingo-lsp MVP, deterministic builds, and CI automation to unblock downstream efforts.
High-priority follow-ups: VS Code extension, watch-mode developer loop, docs site pipeline, and installer/version manager.
Medium/low priorities focus on cross-editor coverage, property tests, lint/fmt commands, scaffolding, telemetry, debugging adapters, and performance suites.
