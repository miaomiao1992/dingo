Functional utilities (map, filter, reduce) will be implemented using Go 1.18+ generics in a new pkg/stdlib package, transpiled from method-style Dingo syntax via a functional_utilities plugin. Development will occur in a git worktree to avoid conflicts with parallel sessions. The architecture prioritizes zero-cost abstractions by generating readable Go code with explicit stdlib function calls, designed for seamless integration with lambdas when implemented and deep integration with Dingo's Result/Option types.
