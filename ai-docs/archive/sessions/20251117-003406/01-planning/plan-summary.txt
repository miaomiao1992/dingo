FUNCTIONAL UTILITIES - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN SUMMARY

Key Decisions:
- Transpile to INLINE LOOPS (not stdlib functions) per feature spec
- Support BOTH Go function literals (now) and lambda syntax (future)
- Full scope: Core (map/filter/reduce) + Helpers (sum/count/all/any/find) + Result/Option integration
- Develop in git worktree for isolation from parallel lambda session

Timeline: 2 weeks (Week 1: Core + helpers, Week 2: Integration + polish)
