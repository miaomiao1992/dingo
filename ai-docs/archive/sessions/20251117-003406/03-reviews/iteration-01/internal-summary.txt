STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 2
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 5

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. cloneExpr does NOT actually clone expressions (returns same pointer, violates AST safety)
2. transformSum missing return type in IIFE function signature (generates invalid Go code)

IMPORTANT ISSUES:
1. Should use stdlib astutil.Apply instead of custom cloneExpr
2. Type inference incomplete (hardcoded int type in sum, no fallback strategy)
3. Missing function arity validation (map/filter/reduce don't validate param count)
4. extractFunctionBody doesn't log why it fails (silent nil returns)
5. Plugin registration order may matter when Result/Option integration is implemented

ESTIMATED FIX TIME: 2-4 hours

STRENGTHS:
- Excellent architecture (IIFE pattern, plugin system integration)
- Clean code generation (idiomatic Go, zero runtime overhead)
- Good structure and readability
- Future-proof for lambda syntax integration

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix CRITICAL-1: Implement proper deep cloning using astutil.Apply
2. Fix CRITICAL-2: Add return type to transformSum IIFE
3. Fix IMPORTANT issues (validation, error messages, documentation)
4. Add integration tests that compile and run generated code
5. Re-review after fixes
