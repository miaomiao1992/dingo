Investigate common idiomatic patterns for organizing templ generated code in Go projects. Focus on:
1. Where original `.templ` source files live.
2. Where generated Go files are emitted and how they coexist with hand-written code.
3. `go.mod` / module boundary considerations.
4. Tooling ergonomics (e.g., `makefiles`, `go:generate` directives).

Provide concrete repository examples (URLs) and directory paths from *real-world open-source projects*. Examples should include projects from `github.com/a-h/templ` official examples or well-known projects using templ. Limit response to ~200 words.
