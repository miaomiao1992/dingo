Investigate common idiomatic patterns for organizing protoc-generated gRPC stubs in Go projects. Focus on:
1. Where original `.proto` schema files live.
2. Where generated Go files are emitted (e.g., `pkg/pb`, `internal/gen`).
3. `go.mod` / module boundary considerations.
4. Tooling ergonomics (e.g., `makefiles`, `go:generate`, `buf.gen.yaml`).

Provide concrete repository examples (URLs) and directory paths. Limit response to ~200 words.
