SUCCESS

Task B1 completed successfully. Swift pattern matching preprocessor implemented with marker normalization.

Files Created:
- pkg/preprocessor/swift_match.go (~475 lines)
- pkg/preprocessor/swift_match_test.go (~400 lines)

Test Results: 13/13 passing (100%)

Key Features:
- Swift syntax: switch/case .Variant(let x)
- Dual guard keywords: both 'where' and 'if' supported
- Marker normalization: IDENTICAL output to RustMatchProcessor
- Manual parsing: robust, no regex lookahead needed
- Body styles: both bare statements and braced blocks

Critical Achievement: Cross-syntax validation passed (TestSwiftMatchProcessor_RustEquivalence) - Swift and Rust generate identical markers, ensuring plugin-level syntax-agnosticism.

Integration Status: Ready for generator.go integration (config-driven processor selection).
