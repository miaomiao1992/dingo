SUCCESS: 11 files created (4 .dingo + 4 .go.golden + 3 dingo.toml)

Test Files:
- swift_match_01_basic (3 files: .dingo, .go.golden, dingo.toml)
- swift_match_02_guards (3 files: .dingo, .go.golden, dingo.toml)
- swift_match_03_nested (3 files: .dingo, .go.golden, dingo.toml)
- swift_match_04_equivalence (2 files: .dingo, .go.golden, NO config)

Test Status: EXPECTED TO FAIL (integration pending)
- Reason: SwiftMatchProcessor not integrated in preprocessor.go yet
- Integration Task: B2 or C (add processor selection logic)
- When Integrated: All 4 tests expected to PASS

Features Covered:
✅ Basic Swift syntax (switch/case, .Variant, let binding)
✅ Guard keywords (both where and if)
✅ Body styles (bare statements and braced blocks)
✅ Nesting (up to triple-nested switches)
✅ Equivalence validation (Rust vs Swift)

File Statistics:
- Total Lines: ~530 (200 .dingo + 324 .go.golden + 6 config)
- Test Complexity: Basic (01) → Intermediate (02) → Advanced (03) + Equivalence (04)
- Golden Test Guidelines: Followed ✅

Next Steps:
1. Remove swift_match tests from golden test skip list (or keep until integration)
2. Integrate SwiftMatchProcessor in preprocessor.go (Task B2/C)
3. Run tests: go test ./tests -run TestGoldenFiles/swift_match -v
4. Verify: 4/4 passing
5. Verify equivalence: Compare swift_match_01 vs swift_match_04 markers

Task D2 Status: COMPLETE ✅
