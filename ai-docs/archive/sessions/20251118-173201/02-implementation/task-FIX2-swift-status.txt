PARTIAL SUCCESS: 2/4 passing (50%)

Passing Tests:
✅ swift_match_01_basic
✅ swift_match_02_guards

Failing Tests:
❌ swift_match_03_nested - Complex nesting parsing issue
❌ swift_match_04_equivalence - Expression context not supported

Core Integration: COMPLETE
- Parser.ParseComments fix applied (all tests now preserve markers)
- Marker order fixed (matches Rust preprocessor)
- Unit tests: 13/13 passing

Blocked By:
- Expression context support (plugin-level AST awareness needed)
- Complex nested switch parsing (preprocessor enhancement needed)

Recommendation: Document as "basic Swift syntax supported, advanced features pending"
