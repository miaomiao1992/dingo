# Task D1: Pattern Guards Golden Tests - Implementation Changes

## Summary

Created 4 comprehensive golden tests for the pattern guards feature, demonstrating guard syntax with both 'if' and 'where' keywords, complex guard expressions, and edge cases.

## Files Created (8 total)

### Test 1: Basic Guards (pattern_match_05_guards_basic)

**Files:**
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_05_guards_basic.dingo` (47 lines)
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_05_guards_basic.go.golden` (96 lines)

**Coverage:**
- Simple guards with 'if' keyword on Result<T,E> type
- Multiple guards on same variant (Ok with different conditions)
- Guards with complex boolean expressions (&&, comparison operators)
- Guards with function call conditions (isEven(n))
- Demonstrates guard fallthrough behavior (when guard fails, tries next case)

**Test Cases in File:**
1. `classifyNumber()` - Guards with simple conditions (x > 0, x < 0)
2. `validateAge()` - Guards with multiple conditions (age >= 18 && age < 65)
3. `checkLength()` - Guards with function call (isEven(n))

**Key Demonstration:**
- Shows how guards generate nested if statements inside case bodies
- Shows duplicate case values allowed (multiple "Ok" cases with different guards)
- Shows catchall pattern without guard (_) handles failed guards

### Test 2: Nested Guards with 'where' (pattern_match_06_guards_nested)

**Files:**
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_06_guards_nested.dingo` (56 lines)
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_06_guards_nested.go.golden` (133 lines)

**Coverage:**
- Swift-style 'where' keyword guards
- Nested pattern matching with guards (Result<Option<T>>)
- Complex guard expressions (modulo operations, multiple conditions)
- Guard fallthrough with multiple conditions per variant

**Test Cases in File:**
1. `analyzeValue()` - Multiple where guards on Option<T> (x > 100, x > 10, x > 0)
2. `processNestedResult()` - Nested Result<Option<T>> with guards
3. `categorize()` - FizzBuzz example showing guard precedence

**Key Demonstration:**
- Both 'if' and 'where' keywords generate identical DINGO_GUARD markers
- Nested patterns (Ok(Some(x))) work with guards
- Multiple guards evaluated in order until one succeeds

### Test 3: Complex Guards (pattern_match_07_guards_complex)

**Files:**
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_07_guards_complex.dingo` (72 lines)
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_07_guards_complex.go.golden` (174 lines)

**Coverage:**
- Mixed 'if' and 'where' keywords in same match expression
- Guards with method calls (strings.HasPrefix, strings.Contains)
- Guards with complex boolean logic (&&, ||, multiple conditions)
- Guards on multi-field variants (Post(path, body))
- Guards on type switch patterns (interface{} matching)

**Test Cases in File:**
1. `routeRequest()` - HTTP routing with guards on different request types
2. `classifyStatus()` - Guards with OR/AND logic combinations
3. `processValue()` - Guards on type switch patterns

**Key Demonstration:**
- 'if' and 'where' can be mixed freely in same match
- Guards work with complex expressions (function calls, field access)
- Guards work with multi-field enum variants
- Wildcard pattern (_) catches all unguarded cases

### Test 4: Edge Cases (pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases)

**Files:**
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases.dingo` (72 lines)
- `/Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases.go.golden` (180 lines)

**Coverage:**
- All arms have guards (requires wildcard fallback)
- Wildcard pattern with guard (_ where condition)
- Many guarded arms (11+ guards in single match) - performance test
- Guards with constant conditions (where true, if 1 > 0)
- Guards with side effects (increment counter) - edge case

**Test Cases in File:**
1. `classify()` - All specific patterns guarded, wildcard catches failures
2. `filterPositive()` - Wildcard with guard (_ where true)
3. `granularClassify()` - 11 guarded arms showing performance scalability
4. `alwaysMatch()` - Guards with constant conditions (optimization test)
5. `countMatches()` - Guards with side effects (not recommended but valid)

**Key Demonstration:**
- When all patterns have guards, must have wildcard fallback
- Wildcard can have guard too (_ where condition)
- Many guards compile efficiently (11+ guards acceptable)
- Constant guard conditions (true, 1 > 0) are valid
- Side effects in guards work but not recommended

## Test Design Decisions

### Progressive Complexity

Following golden test guidelines:
- **Test 05 (Basic)**: Simple guards, single conditions, straightforward patterns
- **Test 06 (Intermediate)**: 'where' keyword, nested patterns, multiple guards per variant
- **Test 07 (Advanced)**: Mixed keywords, complex expressions, multi-field variants
- **Test 08 (Edge Cases)**: All guards, wildcards with guards, performance stress test

### Coverage Strategy

**Guard Keywords:**
- ✅ 'if' keyword (Rust-style) - Tests 05, 07, 08
- ✅ 'where' keyword (Swift-style) - Tests 06, 07
- ✅ Mixed if/where in same match - Test 07

**Guard Complexity:**
- ✅ Simple comparisons (x > 0) - Test 05
- ✅ Multiple conditions (x >= 18 && x < 65) - Test 05
- ✅ Function calls (isEven(n)) - Test 05
- ✅ Method calls (strings.HasPrefix) - Test 07
- ✅ Logical operators (||, &&) - Tests 06, 07
- ✅ Constant conditions (true, 1 > 0) - Test 08
- ✅ Side effects (increment counter) - Test 08

**Pattern Types:**
- ✅ Simple enum variants - All tests
- ✅ Variants with data (Ok(x), Some(x)) - All tests
- ✅ Multi-field variants (Post(path, body)) - Test 07
- ✅ Nested patterns (Ok(Some(x))) - Test 06
- ✅ Wildcard patterns (_) - All tests
- ✅ Wildcard with guard (_ where condition) - Test 08

**Fallthrough Behavior:**
- ✅ Guard fails, tries next case - All tests
- ✅ Multiple guards on same variant - Tests 05, 06, 08
- ✅ All guards fail, hits wildcard - Test 08

**Edge Cases:**
- ✅ All patterns guarded (requires fallback) - Test 08
- ✅ Many guards (11+) - Test 08
- ✅ Guards in nested matches - Test 06
- ✅ Guards with type switches - Test 07

## Golden File Format

All golden files follow the established pattern:

```go
// Dingo pattern with guard:
Result_Ok(x) if x > 0 => "positive"

// Transpiled Go (nested if strategy):
switch __match_0.tag {
case ResultTag_Ok:
    // DINGO_PATTERN: Ok(x) | DINGO_GUARD: x > 0
    x := *__match_0.ok_0
    if x > 0 {
        return "positive"
    }
    // No else - fallthrough to next case
```

**Key Features:**
1. **DINGO_GUARD marker** in comment shows condition
2. **Nested if statement** wraps original body
3. **No else clause** - allows fallthrough to next case
4. **Duplicate case values** allowed (multiple "Ok" cases)
5. **Exhaustiveness check** ignores guards (requires catchall pattern)

## Test Results

### Compilation Tests

All 4 new tests pass compilation:
```
PASS: pattern_match_05_guards_basic_compiles
PASS: pattern_match_06_guards_nested_compiles
PASS: pattern_match_07_guards_complex_compiles
PASS: pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases_compiles
```

### Transpilation Tests

Tests currently skipped (expected) because pattern matching implementation is in Phase 4.2:
```
SKIP: pattern_match_05_guards_basic (Feature not yet implemented - deferred to Phase 3)
SKIP: pattern_match_06_guards_nested (Feature not yet implemented - deferred to Phase 3)
SKIP: pattern_match_07_guards_complex (Feature not yet implemented - deferred to Phase 3)
SKIP: pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases (Feature not yet implemented - deferred to Phase 3)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Tests will run when skipPrefixes list is updated (remove "pattern_match_")
- Tests verify transpiler generates expected Go code with nested if statements
- Tests verify DINGO_GUARD markers are correctly placed

## Backward Compatibility

**Pre-existing Pattern Match Tests:**
- pattern_match_01_basic.dingo
- pattern_match_01_simple.dingo
- pattern_match_02_guards.dingo (different approach than Phase 4.2)
- pattern_match_03_nested.dingo
- pattern_match_04_exhaustive.dingo

**Total Pattern Match Tests:** 13 (9 pre-existing + 4 new)

**New Tests Numbered Correctly:**
- Tests 05-08 follow sequential numbering
- No conflicts with existing tests
- Clear progression: basic → nested → complex → edge cases

## Integration Notes

### For Plugin Implementation (Task B2)

These tests expect:
1. **DINGO_GUARD markers** in comments (format: `// DINGO_GUARD: <condition>`)
2. **Nested if strategy** (user decision from final-plan.md)
3. **No else clause** (fallthrough semantics)
4. **Guard parsing** handles both 'if' and 'where' keywords
5. **Invalid guard syntax** should error with helpful message

### For Preprocessor (Task A1)

These tests expect:
1. **Both 'if' and 'where' keywords** recognized
2. **Guard condition extraction** preserves exact expression text
3. **Complex expressions** parsed correctly (&&, ||, function calls)
4. **Marker format**: `// DINGO_PATTERN: Pattern | DINGO_GUARD: condition`

### For Exhaustiveness Checking

These tests expect:
1. **Guards ignored** for exhaustiveness
2. **Wildcard catchall** required when all patterns have guards
3. **Non-exhaustive error** if missing wildcard (even with guards)
