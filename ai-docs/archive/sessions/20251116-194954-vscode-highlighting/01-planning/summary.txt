VSCODE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING ENHANCEMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Comprehensive architectural plan completed for enhancing Dingo's VSCode experience with three core components: (1) Transpiler marker generation using comment-based annotations to identify generated code sections, (2) Enhanced .dingo syntax highlighting with special treatment for the ? operator and error messages, and (3) VSCode extension with TypeScript-based decorator system to visually highlight generated code in .go and .go.golden files. The recommended approach uses a hybrid marker system (block markers for multi-statement code, inline for single expressions) with configurable visual styles (subtle/bold/outline). Implementation roadmap spans 5 weeks with clear phases: transpiler markers, extension setup, golden file support, enhanced syntax, and polish. Alternative approaches considered and rejected include source map-based highlighting (too complex for MVP), semantic highlighting via LSP (overkill), AST-based detection (unreliable), and separate file extensions (breaks Go compatibility). The design prioritizes ecosystem compatibility, user configurability, and visual clarity without distraction.
