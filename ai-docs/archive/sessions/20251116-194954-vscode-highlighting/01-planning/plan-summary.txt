VSCode Syntax Highlighting - Implementation Plan Summary
=========================================================

BLOCK-LEVEL MARKERS (Transpiler):
- Add DINGO:GENERATED:START/END comments wrapping generated code blocks
- Enabled by default, configurable via Config.EmitGeneratedMarkers
- Markers are standard Go comments, survive go fmt, don't break tooling

CONFIGURABLE VISUAL STYLES (VSCode Extension):
- Settings: subtle (default), bold, outline, disabled
- User can customize colors via dingo.generatedCodeColor settings
- Highlighting appears in .go and .go.golden files automatically

ENHANCED DINGO SYNTAX:
- Special highlighting for error messages: expr? "custom message"
- Muted colors for generated variables: __err0, __tmp0
- Improved Result/Option type highlighting with constructors (Ok, Err, Some, None)

TIMELINE: 4-5 weeks
- Week 1: Transpiler marker injection
- Week 2: VSCode extension core
- Week 3: Enhanced syntax highlighting
- Week 4: Golden file support + polish
- Week 5: Testing & documentation

READY TO BEGIN: Waiting for your approval to start Week 1.
