# User Request: VSCode Syntax Highlighting Enhancement

## Context
We have a golden file testing approach where:
- `.dingo` files contain Dingo source code
- `.go.golden` files contain expected transpiled Go output
- This approach is excellent for understanding what the transpiler does

## Current State
There's already a VSCode extension in `editors/vscode/` with basic syntax highlighting for .dingo files.

## User Request
"is super like the golden approach to see original and then compiled file, lets, ultrathink and add syntax highlighting to our vscode plugin to highlight the golden file and if its possible we need to highlight the generated parts"

## Goals

### 1. Enhanced .dingo Syntax Highlighting
- Review and improve the current VSCode extension syntax highlighting
- Make sure all Dingo-specific syntax is properly highlighted:
  - `?` operator (error propagation)
  - Error message syntax: `expr? "message"`
  - Result/Option types
  - Pattern matching
  - Other Dingo-specific features

### 2. Highlight Generated Parts in .go Files
- When viewing transpiled .go files, highlight the parts that were generated by the transpiler
- This helps users understand what code the transpiler added vs what was in the original
- Possible approaches:
  - Add special comments to mark generated code sections
  - Create VSCode decorators/semantic highlighting
  - Use background colors or borders to distinguish generated code

### 3. Golden File Support
- Add syntax highlighting for `.go.golden` files
- Potentially add diff-like visualization to compare .dingo with .go.golden side-by-side

## Expected Deliverables
1. Enhanced VSCode extension with improved .dingo syntax highlighting
2. Mechanism to mark and highlight generated Go code sections
3. Support for .go.golden files
4. Documentation on how to use the enhanced features
5. Example files showing the highlighting in action

## Technical Considerations
- The transpiler should add markers (comments or metadata) to generated code
- VSCode extension should detect these markers and apply highlighting
- Should work seamlessly with existing VSCode Go extension
- Should be visually clear but not intrusive
