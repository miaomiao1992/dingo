# User Request - Phase 4 Implementation

**Context**: Another agent is finalizing Phase 3 implementation (there are a couple of minor issues and tests to fix). We are now starting Phase 4.

**Request**: Start implementing Phase 4

**Phase 4 Goals** (from CLAUDE.md):
1. Pattern matching implementation
2. Full go/types context integration (AST parent tracking)
3. None constant context inference
4. Enhanced error messages with suggestions

**Current Status**:
- Phase 3 is 97.8% complete (261/267 tests passing)
- Two-stage transpilation pipeline is working
- Result<T,E> and Option<T> types are fully implemented
- Error propagation (`?` operator) is working
- Enum/sum types are implemented

**Phase 4 Focus**: Implement pattern matching and improve type inference with full go/types integration.
