STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 3
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 7

BLOCKING ISSUES:
- C1: Nil pointer dereference in generateVariantFields (line 273)
- C2: Match expression type mismatch (expr vs stmt) (line 468)
- C3: Nil variant access in transformMatchArm (line 484)
- I1: Missing fmt import in participle.go (line 668)

SUMMARY:
Solid architectural foundation with well-designed AST nodes and comprehensive parser grammar. Code is well-documented and follows Go idioms. However, has 3 critical correctness bugs and completely missing tests. Fix blocking issues and add basic unit tests before proceeding to Phase 3.

KEY STRENGTHS:
+ Excellent documentation quality
+ Clean plugin architecture integration
+ Proper placeholder pattern for Dingo nodes
+ Comprehensive grammar with trailing comma support

MAIN CONCERNS:
- No tests written (major deviation from plan)
- Critical nil pointer vulnerabilities
- Match transformation incomplete (stmt vs expr)
- Type inference integration missing (expected in Phase 3)
