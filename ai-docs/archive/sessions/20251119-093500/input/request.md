Task: Investigate reported test failures across pattern matching golden tests, integration tests, and compilation tests. Determine root causes, classify test vs implementation issues, prioritize them, and recommend fixes referencing specific files.

Context Summary:
- 8 pattern matching golden tests failing (nested patterns, guards, tuples)
- 4 integration tests failing (pattern match rust syntax, non-exhaustive, none contexts)
- 2 compilation tests failing (error propagation, option literals)

Deliverables:
- Executive summary
- Category-by-category analysis with root causes, priority, and recommendations
- Detailed findings per specific failure
- Action plan and affected files list
