# Task
Evaluate enum variant naming conventions (options A-D) for Dingo-generated Go code. Recommend most Go-idiomatic approach, analyze trade-offs, migration path, edge cases, implementation notes.

# Context Summary
- Current naming uses underscores (Option A)
- Need assessment vs alternatives (B pure CamelCase, C namespaced, D mixed)
- Criteria: Go idiomaticity, clarity, collision avoidance, pattern matching ergonomics, type safety, readability, IDE experience

# Deliverables
- Recommendation with rationale
- Trade-offs table or bullet list
- Migration plan from Option A if change suggested
- Edge cases + implementation considerations
- References to Go conventions (std lib patterns) where relevant
