# Task D: Implementation Notes

## Deviations from Plan

No significant deviations. The implementation followed the plan template exactly (lines 251-340).

## Additional Enhancements

1. **Contributing Section Enhancement**: Added rule #7 "NEVER run processors after import injection" to reinforce the CRITICAL POLICY for future contributors.

2. **Section Organization**: Maintained existing sections that were not in the plan template but provide value:
   - "Why Preprocessor vs Transformer?" section (provides architectural context)
   - "Implementation Details" section (practical examples)
   - "Testing" section (developer workflow)
   - "Future Enhancements" section (roadmap)
   - "Related Packages" section (navigation)

## Quality Notes

- The README is comprehensive (242 lines) but remains readable
- CRITICAL POLICY is mentioned in 3 strategic locations:
  1. Stage 2 header (line 34)
  2. Processing Flow step 3 (line 143)
  3. Contributing rules (line 237)
- Visual examples and code snippets make complex concepts clear
- Proper formatting with markdown code blocks and lists
