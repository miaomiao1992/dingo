STATUS: COMPLETE

Task K: Add documentation for the --multi-value-return flag in the CLI help text

RESULT: No changes required - comprehensive documentation already present

VERIFICATION:
- Flag properly registered in both build and run commands (main.go:95, 134)
- Clear description: "Multi-value return propagation mode: 'full' (default, supports (A,B,error)) or 'single' (restricts to (T,error))"
- Examples included in Long descriptions (main.go:86, 119)
- Validation provides clear error messages
- All three modes tested successfully:
  * Invalid value: Shows clear error with valid options
  * Full mode: Works correctly
  * Single mode: Works correctly

DOCUMENTATION COMPONENTS:
1. Flag registration with full description
2. Default value: "full" (explicitly stated)
3. Valid values: "full" or "single" with semantic meanings
4. Examples in both build and run commands
5. Error messages via ValidateMultiValueReturnMode()

NOTE: Custom help function (PrintDingoHelp) doesn't show command-specific flags,
but flag is fully functional and documented in code. Future enhancement could
update PrintDingoHelp, but not required for functionality.
