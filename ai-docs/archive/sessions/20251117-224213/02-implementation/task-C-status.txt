SUCCESS: Already fixed - Issue #3 is not a bug. Code correctly prevents import collision by requiring qualified calls (pkg.Function). Bare function names like ReadFile() are ignored (len(parts) >= 2 check on line 860). Only qualified calls like os.ReadFile() trigger imports. Two-layer protection: tracking filter + map lookup. Code review concern was invalid.
