Comprehensive architectural plan completed for 4 code review issues. Analysis reveals Issue #1 (source map offset) requires a trivial one-line fix (>= to >), while Issues #2 and #3 appear already fixed in the codebase. Primary work involves adding comprehensive negative tests (Issue #4) to prevent regressions. Overall risk is LOW with estimated 4.5-hour implementation timeline.
