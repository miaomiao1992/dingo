### Detailed Findings
#### Category 1: Pattern Matching Golden Tests
*   **`pattern_match_03_nested` - Nested pattern matching**:
    *   **Failure:** Preprocessor incorrectly processes nested enum variants, and the `pattern_match` plugin fails to generate appropriate nested Go control flow (e.g., chained `if` statements or nested `switch` statements) for unwrapping and binding values. The lack of a structured representation of nested patterns means the plugin cannot discern the internal structure (e.g., `Value_Int(n)` within `Result_Ok`).
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Requires extensive refactoring of `pkg/plugin/builtin/pattern_match.go` to introduce a recursive pattern parsing mechanism from comments, and a recursive AST transformation to generate multi-level Go code.
*   **`pattern_match_06_guards_nested` - Nested guards**:
    *   **Failure:** Similar to `pattern_match_03_nested`, but with the added complexity of guard conditions. The current guard transformation likely only handles single-level `if` conditions, failing to integrate them correctly within nested pattern matching logic.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Builds upon the nested pattern matching fix. Guard expressions must be carried through the nested structure and applied at the appropriate level of unwrapping.
*   **`pattern_match_07_guards_complex` - Complex guard expressions**:
    *   **Failure:** Implies issues in parsing or validating complex Go expressions within `if` guard conditions. `pkg/plugin/builtin/pattern_match.go`'s `validateGuardExpression` and `injectNestedIf` are the points of failure.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Ensure `parser.ParseExpr` correctly handles a wider range of Go expressions, and that type checking of guard conditions (if `go/types` is used) is robust.
*   **`pattern_match_08_guards_edge_cases` - Guard edge cases**:
    *   **Failure:** Could be related to variable scoping within guards or side effects. The generated Go code might have incorrect variable visibility or unintentional interactions.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Requires careful testing of generated Go code for correctness and adherence to Go scoping rules, potentially by expanding test cases.
*   **`pattern_match_09_tuple_pairs`, `pattern_match_10_tuple_triples`, `pattern_match_11_tuple_wildcards` - Tuple pattern matching**:
    *   **Failure:** The `tuple` processing in `pkg/preprocessor/rust_match.go` (functions like `generateTupleMatch`, `generateTupleCase`) and its corresponding interpretation in `pkg/plugin/builtin/pattern_match.go` (`detectTupleMatch`, `parseTupleArms`) are likely incomplete or incorrect. This includes destructuring elements and handling wildcards.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Review `generateTupleMatch` and `generateTupleCase` to ensure they correctly generate initial Go code reflecting tuple destructuring. More importantly, `PatternMatchPlugin` needs a dedicated transformation pipeline for tuple contexts, generating correct individual variable assignments and nested checks for each element.
*   **`pattern_match_12_tuple_exhaustiveness` - Tuple exhaustiveness checking**:
    *   **Failure:** `PatternMatchPlugin.checkTupleExhaustiveness` is not correctly identifying all possible patterns or combinations for tuples, especially with mixed types and wildcards, leading to non-exhaustive matches being undetected or false positives.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Debug `NewTupleExhaustivenessChecker` and its `Check` method to ensure comprehensive coverage, potentially using a matrix-based approach to account for all possible variants in each tuple position.

#### Category 2: Integration Tests
*   **`pattern_match_rust_syntax`**:
    *   **Failure:** `undefined: Result_int_error` and `undefined: ResultTagOk`. The `ResultTypePlugin` in `pkg/plugin/builtin/result_type.go` is not emitting the definition for `Result_int_error` and its associated `ResultTag` constants when encountered as a concrete type name in the function signature `func handleResult(r Result_int_error) string`.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** `ResultTypePlugin.Process` needs to be enhanced to proactively identify and register `Result_T_E` types from `ast.Ident` instances that match the expected naming pattern, ensuring their declarations are emitted.
*   **`pattern_match_non_exhaustive_error`**:
    *   **Failure:** The test expects a `non-exhaustive match` error from `PatternMatchPlugin`, but it's not being reported correctly or caught by the test's `plugin.Context`.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Verify the error accumulation and reporting mechanisms within `pkg/plugin/context.go`, ensuring `ReportError` stores the error and `HasErrors()`/`GetErrors()` correctly retrieve it. The `testLogger` in `tests/integration_phase4_test.go` also needs examination.
*   **`none_context_inference_return`**:
    *   **Failure:** `None` cannot be inferred from the return type `Option_int` of `func getAge(valid bool) Option_int`. The `OptionTypePlugin.inferNoneTypeFromContext` explicitly states it's a stub in Phase 3.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Fully implement `OptionTypePlugin.inferNoneTypeFromContext` (`pkg/plugin/builtin/option_type.go`) to leverage `go/types` information and AST parent tracking. For `return None`, it must look at the enclosing function's return signature.
*   **`combined_pattern_match_and_none`**:
    *   **Failure:** A combination of the above. Likely errors due to `None` inference failure (`return None`) preventing proper transformation, and potential issues with `Result_string_error` not being correctly emitted. Additionally, type inference for `Some(len(s))` might be a problem if `len(s)`'s type (`int`) isn't accurately inferred.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Fixes for `pattern_match_rust_syntax` and `none_context_inference_return` are prerequisites. Verify `OptionTypePlugin.inferTypeFromExpr` accurately determines the type of the argument passed to `Some()`.

#### Category 3: Compilation Tests
*   **`error_prop_02_multiple_compiles`**:
    *   **Failure:** `Unmarshal(data, &result)?` is transpiled into `__tmp1, __err1 := Unmarshal(data, ILLEGALresult)` and `var err = __tmp1`. The `Unmarshal` function returns only an `error`, not a `(value, error)` tuple, making `__tmp1` non-existent. `ILLEGALresult` indicates that the argument `&result` was also mishandled during the transformation process.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** The `ErrorPropProcessor.expandAssignment` function (`pkg/preprocessor/error_prop.go`) must be refactored. It needs to distinguish between `(value, error)` and `(error)` return signatures for the function being `?`-ed. For `(error)`-only functions, the `__tmpN` variable generation and subsequent assignment (`var varName = __tmpN`) should be omitted, and the `error`-consuming argument should be correctly preserved.
*   **`option_02_literals_compiles`**:
    *   **Failure:** The generated Go code contains invalid type declarations like `type Option_interface{} struct { ... }`. This is because `interface{}` is not consistently sanitized to a valid Go identifier (e.g., `any`) when constructing the `Option_T` type name.
    *   **Resolution Strategy:** Critically examine `OptionTypePlugin.sanitizeTypeName` in `pkg/plugin/builtin/option_type.go` and all call sites that form `optionTypeName` to ensure consistent application of sanitization, replacing `interface{}` with `any` in identifier generation. Similarly, check `ResultTypePlugin` (`pkg/plugin/builtin/result_type.go`) for the same issue.

### Recommended Action Plan

1.  **Fix Error Propagation Transformation (PKG/PREPROCESSOR/ERROR_PROP.GO):**
    *   **Task**: Update `ErrorPropProcessor.expandAssignment` to intelligently handle functions returning only `error` vs. `(value, error)`. For functions like `json.Unmarshal` that return only `error` and modify arguments by reference, the transformation for `expr?` should only generate the `__errN := expr; if __errN != nil { ... }` block and *omit* any `__tmpN` declaration and subsequent `var varName = __tmpN` assignment if one is requested (or flag an error if the Dingo source explicitly tries to bind a non-existent success value).

2.  **Ensure Consistent Type Name Sanitization (PKG/PLUGIN/BUILTIN/OPTION_TYPE.GO, PKG/PLUGIN/BUILTIN/RESULT_TYPE.GO):**
    *   **Task**: Review all instances where `optionTypeName` and `resultTypeName` are constructed. Guarantee that `p.sanitizeTypeName()` correctly transforms `interface{}` to `any` *before* it's embedded into the type name string, preventing invalid Go identifiers.

3.  **Proactive Result Type Emission (PKG/PLUGIN/BUILTIN/RESULT_TYPE.GO):**
    *   **Task**: Enhance `ResultTypePlugin.Process` to identify `ast.Ident` nodes that match the `Result_T_E` naming convention (e.g., `Result_int_error`) and trigger `emitResultDeclaration` accordingly to generate the necessary struct and tag constants. This should ensure `ResultTagOk` and `Result_int_error` are defined when needed.

4.  **Implement `None` Context Inference (PKG/PLUGIN/BUILTIN/OPTION_TYPE.GO):**
    *   **Task**: Replace the stub in `OptionTypePlugin.inferNoneTypeFromContext`. Implement logic that correctly uses `p.ctx.TypeInfo` (via `TypeInferenceService`) and AST parent tracking to determine the expected `Option<T>` type from the surrounding context (e.g., assignment target, function return type).

5.  **Enhance Pattern Matching for Nested Variants (PKG/PLUGIN/BUILTIN/PATTERN_MATCH.GO):**
    *   **Task A: Structured Pattern Parsing**: Refactor `PatternMatchPlugin.parsePatternArms` to parse the `// DINGO_PATTERN:` comments into a recursive data structure that accurately represents nested enum variants and their bindings.
    *   **Task B: Nested AST Transformation**: Implement logic in `PatternMatchPlugin.Transform` to dynamically generate nested Go control flow (`if-else` or `switch` statements) based on the parsed nested pattern structure. This will involve the use of generated `Is<Variant>()` and `Unwrap<Variant>()` methods.
    *   **Task C: Robust Exhaustiveness Checking**: Update `PatternMatchPlugin.checkExhaustiveness` and related functions to perform comprehensive exhaustiveness checks for nested enum and tuple variants.

6.  **Verify `plugin.Context` Error Reporting (PKG/PLUGIN/CONTEXT.GO, TESTS/INTEGRATION_PHASE4_TEST.GO):**
    *   **Task**: Confirm the `plugin.Context`'s error handling and accumulation mechanisms are fully functional. This involves verifying that calls to `ReportError` are consistently captured and that `HasErrors()` and `GetErrors()` correctly reflect the reported errors within the test framework.

### Files to Modify

*   `pkg/preprocessor/error_prop.go`
*   `pkg/plugin/builtin/option_type.go`
*   `pkg/plugin/builtin/result_type.go`
*   `pkg/plugin/builtin/pattern_match.go`
*   `pkg/plugin/context.go` (if necessary)
*   `pkg/types/inference.go` (for `TypeInferenceService` implementation details)
*   `tests/integration_phase4_test.go` (if context error reporting is a test-side issue)
*   `tests/golden/error_prop_02_multiple.dingo`: Might need modification if the `let err` syntax usage is fundamentally at odds with the `error`-only return of `Unmarshal` and we decide to disallow it.
*   `tests/golden/option_02_literals.dingo`: No changes needed in this, but `.go.golden` will change.

Now that the entire plan is outlined, I will use `ExitPlanMode`.
