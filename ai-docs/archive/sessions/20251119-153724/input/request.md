Request: Enum Variant Naming Convention Validation

Context:
Dingo is a meta-language for Go (like TypeScript for JavaScript) that provides sum types/enums. We need to validate our naming convention for enum variants.

... (abbreviated for brevity) 

Questions for External Models:
1. Which naming convention (A, B, C, or D) is most Go-idiomatic?
2. Are there better alternatives not listed above?
3. What are the trade-offs of each approach?
4. How do other Go libraries handle discriminated unions / sum types?
5. What would Go developers expect when using Dingo-generated code?
6. Does the underscore convention have any benefits that outweigh non-idiomaticity?
