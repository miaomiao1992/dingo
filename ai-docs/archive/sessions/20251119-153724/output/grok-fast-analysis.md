## Multi-Model Enum Variant Naming Analysis Complete ✅

I've consulted 3 external LLM models (Sherlock Think Alpha, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok Code Fast) on Dingo's enum variant naming convention, and all three independently converged on the same recommendation.

### 📊 Consensus Analysis (3/3 Models Agree)

**Answer to Question 1:** Convention C - PascalCase for all variants (`Ok<T>`, `Err<E>`, `Some<T>`, `None`) is most Go-idiomatic.

**Key Reasons (Across All Models):**
- **Go Compatibility**: Variants become exported Go functions/types, following Go's PascalCase export convention
- **Language Precedents**: Aligns with Rust/Kotlin/Swift patterns where variants are type-constructs
- **Pattern Matching**: Natural, readable syntax in match expressions
- **Transpiler Simplicity**: No additional preprocessing logic needed

**Answer to Question 2:** No better alternatives identified. Models evaluated proposals like lowercase/constants but concluded they create more compatibility issues than they solve.

**Answer to Question 3 (Trade-offs):**
- **PascalCase +**: Consistent Go naming, natural match syntax, type-like variant semantics  
- **Snake_case --**: Non-idiomatic (breaks Go export conventions), poor IDE support, visually ambiguous
- **UPPER_CASE --**: Works for constants but inappropriate for variants (creates false expectation of enum values)

**Answer to Question 4 (Other Go Libraries):** Go lacks established sum type libraries due to ongoing proposals (#19412), but implementations will likely mirror Dingo's approach using convenient PascalCase.

**Answer to Question 5 (Go Developer Expectations):** Exported identifiers using PascalCase - variants as "pseudo-types" you can construct like `Ok(value)` rather than constants.

**Answer to Question 6:** The underscore convention (`ShapeTag_Circle`) provides marginal naming collision protection but was unanimously rejected as too verbose and violating Go's naming philosophy. **Trade-off doesn't outweigh the non-idiomatic penalty.**

### 🎯 Recommendation
Stick with current PascalCase implementation - it's the correct choice and requires no changes.
