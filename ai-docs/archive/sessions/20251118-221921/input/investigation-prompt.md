Analyze the file organization strategy for Dingo using Grok. Your role is to evaluate as a systems programming consultant.

Focus Areas:
- Cargo Comparison: Can Rust's target/ model apply to source-to-source transpilers?
- Build Artifacts: How Rust tools handle generated outputs  
- LSP Mapping: How rust-analyzer handles macro-expanded code
- Systems Design: Performance implications, compilation caching, dependency management

Dingo Context: Dingo is a meta-language for Go that transpiles .dingo files to idiomatic .go files using a two-stage approach: Stage 1 preprocessors (text-based Dingo→valid Go) followed by Stage 2 AST processing (plugins for semantic transformations like Result/Option types). It provides Result<T,E> with ? operator, Option<T>, pattern matching, and sum types.

Current File Organization:
- .dingo source files
- Generated .go files from transpilation
- .sourcemap files for LSP
- Architecture includes preprocessor (regex-based text transformations), go/parser (native), AST plugin pipeline

Goal: Apply lessons from Rust/Cargo ecosystem to Dingo's build system for better compilation performance, caching, and IDE support.
