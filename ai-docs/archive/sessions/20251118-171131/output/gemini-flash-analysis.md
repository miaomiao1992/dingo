I have completed the comprehensive implementation guide for context-aware preprocessing in Dingo.

Here is a summary of the key findings and recommendations:

**1. Recommended Strategy:**
*   **Hybrid Markers + AST Metadata (Strategy F)**: This approach leverages minimal, explicit markers (`/*DINGO_*/` comments) injected by the Stage 1 preprocessor, combined with a powerful Stage 2 AST plugin that interprets these markers, builds rich in-memory context, and uses `go/types` for deep semantic analysis and transformation.

**2. Architecture Design:**
*   **Stage 1 (Preprocessor)**: Converts Dingo syntax (e.g., `match`) into valid Go stub code and injects specific `/*DINGO_*/` markers with metadata.
*   **Stage 2 (AST plugin)**: Parses the Go code (preserving comments), extracts marker data into in-memory `DingoContext` objects, performs type checking and semantic analysis using `go/types`, then transforms the AST into final idiomatic Go code.

**3. Context Tracking Mechanism:**
*   A combination of **AST comments (for initial markers)** and **in-memory data structures (for rich semantic context)** built during AST traversal. This provides flexibility and efficiency.

**4. `go/types` Integration:**
*   `go/types` is essential for type inference, object resolution, and scope information within the generated Go code. It will be used in Stage 2 to enrich the `DingoContext` and perform Dingo-specific semantic validations (e.g., exhaustiveness for match patterns). It understands valid Go only; Dingo-specific semantics are correlated via markers.

**5. Performance Impact:**
*   Estimated to be in the range of **40-70ms per 1000 LOC**. While potentially at the higher end of the `<50ms` target, this is acceptable given the deep semantic analysis and transformation involved. Mitigation strategies include sharing the `go/types.Info` instance and continuous benchmarking.

**6. Migration Path (Phased Rollout):**
*   **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation**: Implement marker utilities, basic `match` transformation for `Result<T,E>` (Ok/Err), and core `go/types` integration.
*   **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Semantic Awareness**: Enhance plugins with exhaustiveness checks, specific value handling (e.g., `Err(NotFound)`), for `Result<T,E>` and `Option<T>`.
*   **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Advanced Features & Robustness**: Support nested matches, advanced lambdas, performance tuning, and edge case handling.

**7. Risks and Mitigations:**
*   Key risks include complexity creep in the preprocessor, marker robustness, performance degradation, and debugging complexity. Strategies focus on strict separation of concerns, robust error handling, early benchmarking, and comprehensive testing.

**8. Success Metrics:**
*   Correctness (100% golden tests), semantic validation accuracy (>95%), performance (<50ms/1000 LOC), generated Go code readability, maintainability, and precise sourcemap accuracy (>99%).

This plan provides actionable, concrete guidance for integrating context-awareness into the Dingo transpilation pipeline.
