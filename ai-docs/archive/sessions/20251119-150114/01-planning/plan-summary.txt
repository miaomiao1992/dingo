Phase V Final Plan: Infrastructure & Tooling (Engine-Free)

SCOPE:
- NO test fixes, NO engine changes, NO language features
- ONLY: Documentation, CI/CD, validation, tooling around working features

PRIORITIES:
1. Package Management Docs (Week 1) - Hybrid workflow (libs→.go, apps→.dingo), 3 example projects
2. CI/CD Enhancements (Week 2) - Diff visualization, performance tracking, auto-docs
3. Source Map Validation (Week 2-3) - Read-only validation suite, schema docs, round-trip tests
4. Developer Experience (Week 3) - Getting started guide, feature docs, migration guide
5. Workspace Builds (Week 4, Optional) - Multi-package support, `dingo build ./...`

TIMELINE: 3-4 weeks, zero engine modifications

DELIVERABLES:
✅ Package management strategy documented with examples
✅ Enhanced CI/CD with visualization and automation
✅ Source map validation suite (>99.9% accuracy)
✅ Developer documentation (getting started, features, migration)
✅ Optional: Workspace build infrastructure

RISK: Low (no engine changes, no test fixes, infrastructure only)
