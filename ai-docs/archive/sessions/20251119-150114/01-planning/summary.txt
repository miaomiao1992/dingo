Phase V Status: ~70% Complete (LSP + VS Code production-ready)

Critical infrastructure exists: Language Server (dingo-lsp), VS Code extension (v0.2.0), CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive test suite (39/46 golden tests passing). Main gaps: 7 failing pattern match tests, source map validation suite, workspace builds, and debugging support.

Recommended path: Fix 7 failing tests (1-2 weeks) → Validate source maps (1 week) → Enhance CI (1 week) → Then tackle workspace builds (3-4 weeks) and debugging (6-8 weeks). Phase V.1 (100% test pass rate + validated source maps) can be completed in 3 weeks and is the recommended v1.0 quality gate.
