The build failures stem from duplicate error propagation implementations: a complete preprocessor (693 lines, working) and an incomplete AST transformer (262 lines, conflicting). Solution: remove the transformer version, keep the preprocessor, and add automatic import detection to fix golden test compilation errors. This cleanup establishes clear architectural boundaries and enables future feature development.
