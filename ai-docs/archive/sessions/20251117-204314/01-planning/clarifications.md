# User Clarifications

## Question 1: Import Detection Approach
**Answer**: Automatic import detection (2 hours)
**Implication**: Implement production-ready solution that automatically detects and adds imports for error propagation contexts.

## Question 2: Transform Pipeline Usage
**Answer**: Other features exist
**Implication**: Need to check for lambdas, pattern matching, or other partial implementations before removing transform code. Must preserve any working features.

## Question 3: File Preservation
**Answer**: Delete completely
**Implication**: Remove error_prop.go entirely. Git history provides backup if needed.
