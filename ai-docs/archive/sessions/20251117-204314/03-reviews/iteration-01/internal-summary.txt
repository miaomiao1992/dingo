STATUS: APPROVED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 0
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 2

Overall Score: 9.2/10
Confidence: HIGH (95%)

Summary:
Build fix implementation successfully resolves all critical issues while establishing clean architectural separation. Code quality is high with comprehensive test coverage (100% pass rate) and excellent documentation. Two IMPORTANT enhancements identified for future phases, but no blocking issues.

Key Strengths:
- Clean preprocessor/transformer separation with clear rationale
- Automatic import detection system elegant and extensible
- Source mapping correctness validated by comprehensive tests
- Documentation exemplary (README files explain "why" not just "what")
- Zero reinvention - proper use of Go stdlib and x/tools

Issues Found:
IMPORTANT-1: Import detection incomplete for qualified calls (http.Get, filepath.Join)
IMPORTANT-2: Source map adjustment calculation could use defensive validation
MINOR-1: stdLibFunctions map could be more comprehensive (15+ packages missing)
MINOR-2: Magic comments generated but not yet consumed (expected, LSP not built)
MINOR-3: Silent fallbacks in injectImports should return errors
MINOR-4: No tests for transform package (acceptable, skeleton code)
MINOR-5: getZeroValue edge cases for type aliases and generics

Recommendation: MERGE NOW
- Address IMPORTANT-1 before Phase 3 (Result/Option integration)
- Address IMPORTANT-2 in next refactoring pass
- Track MINOR issues for future sprints

Test Results:
- Build: ✓ All packages compile successfully
- Tests: ✓ 100% pass rate (8 functions, 11 subtests)
- Coverage: ✓ Comprehensive (error propagation, import detection, source mapping)
- Parser: ✗ Unrelated failures (sum types, lambdas not yet implemented)

Architecture Validation:
- Preprocessor vs Transformer split: APPROVED (well-justified, documented)
- Import detection via ImportProvider interface: EXCELLENT design
- Source map adjustment strategy: SOUND (validated by tests)
- Zero reinvention detected: EXCELLENT (proper use of astutil, go/parser, go/printer)
