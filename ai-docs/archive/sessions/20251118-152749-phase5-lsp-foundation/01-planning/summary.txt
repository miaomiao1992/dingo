Phase V LSP Architecture Plan Complete

Status: Ready for Review
Approach: gopls proxy with bidirectional position translation via source maps
Scope: Phase 3 features only (Result/Option/enums/error propagation)
Components: dingo-lsp binary, gopls client, source map cache, file watcher, VSCode extension
Estimated Effort: 1-2 weeks (~1200 LOC, 5 phases)
Key Innovation: Zero language feature reimplementation - 100% leverage of gopls
Open Questions: 10 gaps identified in gaps.json (gopls version, file watching strategy, etc.)
Next Step: User review and gap resolution
