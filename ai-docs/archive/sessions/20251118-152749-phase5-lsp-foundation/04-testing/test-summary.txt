- Build: Binary builds successfully (5.8 MB)

Benchmarks (All Targets Exceeded):
- Position Translation: 2.69 µs/op (target: <5 µs) ✅
- Cache Get: 60 ns/op (target: <100 ns) ✅
- Path Utilities: 2-15 ns/op (zero allocations) ✅

Code Review Fixes Verified:
✅ Error handling in cache (missing files, invalid JSON)
✅ Concurrency safety (no data races, mutex protection)
✅ Resource cleanup (file watcher, channels)
