Gather comprehensive recommendations for enum variant naming conventions in the Dingo language.

Dingo is a Go transcompiler that adds sum types through enum keywords. Current examples include:

enum Result< T, E> { Ok<T> Err<E> }

enum Optional<T> { Some<T> None }

enum Tree { Leaf(value int) Node(left *Tree, right *Tree) }

Task: Provide detailed analysis and recommendations covering:

- Naming conventions from language precedents (Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Haskell)

- Idiomatic Go compatibility (how variants translate to Go types)

- Pattern matching readability (e.g., match r { Ok(x) => ..., Err(e) => ... })

- Constructor clarity and usability

- Consistency with Dingo's type system (Result/Option as standard library types)

- Go community preferences for sum type terminology

- Trade-offs between different naming approaches (CamelCase, snake_case, UPPER_CASE)

Provide specific recommendations with code examples showing good and bad practices, pros/cons, implementation considerations for the transpiler/parser, and final recommended naming standard for Dingo enums.
