# Gemini 3 Pro Preview Analysis on Dingo Enum Variant Naming Conventions

## Analysis of Current Dingo Approach

The current Dingo approach uses PascalCase for both enum types and variants (e.g., `PaymentStatus`, `Pending`, `Completed`). This matches Go's standard naming conventions for exported identifiers, ensuring consistency with the Go ecosystem.

## Comparative Analysis of Other Languages

### Go (Reference Point)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`HttpMethod`, `PaymentStatus`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase (`GET`, `POST`) or CamelCase for unexported
- **No native enums**: Uses iota constants or custom types
- **Convention**: Exported identifiers start with capital letter

### Rust (Strong influence on Dingo sum types)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`HttpMethod`, `Result<T, E>`)
- **Variants**: PascalCase (`Ok`, `Err`, `Some`, `None`)
- **Philosophy**: All types and variants are "exported" (public) so PascalCase everywhere
- **Benefit**: Consistent PascalCase creates visual harmony, variants are type-like

### Swift
- **Types**: PascalCase (`HttpMethod`, `Result<T, Error>`)
- **Variants**: PascalCase (`Success`, `Failure`)
- **Philosophy**: Variants are considered types themselves
- **Result**: `Result<T, Error>.success(value)` looks type-like

### Kotlin
- **Types**: PascalCase (`HttpMethod`, `Result<T, E>`)
- **Variants**: PascalCase (`Success`, `Failure`)
- **Sealed classes**: Similar to enums but more flexible
- **Convention**: All "types" (classes, enums) are PascalCase

## Recommendation for Dingo

### Primary Recommendation: Maintain PascalCase for Variants

**Rationale:**
1. **Go Ecosystem Harmony**: Dingo generates Go code that must integrate seamlessly. Exported identifiers (types, functions, methods) are PascalCase.

2. **Language Family Consistency**: All major languages with sum types (Rust, Swift, Kotlin) use PascalCase for both types AND variants.

3. **Type vs Variant Distinction is Unnecessary**: In sum types, variants ARE types too - they represent entire type states. The distinction between "type name" and "variant name" is artificial.

4. **Pattern Matching Clarity**: PascalCase variants look more "type-like", which helps in pattern matching: `match result { Ok(x) => ..., Err(e) => ... }`

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Visual Consistency**: `PaymentStatus.Pending` looks like any other Go type.field access
2. **IDE Support**: Go tools expect PascalCase for exported members
3. **Future-Proof**: If variants need to become types later (further Rust-ification), they're already named correctly
4. **Language Expectations**: Users coming from Rust/Swift expect PascalCase

### Potential Concerns Addressed

**Concern**: Visual ambiguity between type and variant names?
- **Mitigation**: Context always makes this clear. In `PaymentStatus.Pending`, `PaymentStatus` is obviously the type, `Pending` the variant.

**Concern**: Go conventions are different?
- **Response**: Go doesn't have sum types, so these conventions don't apply. Dingo is extending Go with new semantics, so different conventions are justified (like how generics introduced angle brackets).

**Concern**: First-class readability?
- **Response**: PascalCase creates strong visual separation between words (`SomeValue` vs `somevalue`). This is far more readable than camelCase or snake_case for compound words.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option 2: camelCase Variants
```dingo
enum PaymentStatus { pending, completed(orderId: int), failed(error: string) }
```
**Pros**: Distinct from types, might feel more "value-like"
**Cons**: Inconsistent with Go exported identifiers, looks odd in generated Go code, violates Dingo's PascalCase convention throughout.

### Option 3: snake_case Variants
```dingo
enum PaymentStatus { PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED }
```
**Pros**: Clear all-caps distinction from types
**Cons**: Looks like old C code, hard to read, Go doesn't use all-caps anymore.

### Option 4: Mixed Approach
- Types: PascalCase
- Variants: camelCase
- Values: snake_case

**Pros**: Maximum differentiation
**Cons**: Extremely complex rule with no clear benefit - more cognitive load than value.

## Implementation Notes

### Code Generation Impact
- Maintain current approach: variants generate as exported constants
- No changes needed to transpiler logic
- Pattern matching syntax remains simple: `Ok(x) => expr`

### Documentation Guidelines
Clearly document that Dingo variants follow PascalCase like their parent types, unlike some generic enums in other systems.

### Migration Path
- Current approach is already correct and consistent with examples (`Ok`, `Err`, `Some`, `None`)
- No breaking changes needed

## Conclusion

**Stick with PascalCase for enum variants.** This maintains consistency with:
- Go's exported identifier conventions
- The language family Dingo draws from (Rust/Swift/Kotlin)
- Current Dingo examples and philosophy

The distinction between "type names" and "variant names" is artificial in sum types - both represent abstracted concepts worthy of PascalCase. Any naming confusion is resolved by context and IDE tooling.

## Examples in Practice

### Dingo Code (Recommended)
```dingo
enum PaymentStatus {
    Pending,
    Completed(orderId: int),
    Failed(error: string)
}

enum Result<T, E> { Ok(value: T), Err(error: E) }
enum Option<T> { Some(value: T), None }
```

### Generated Go Code (Compatible)
```go
type PaymentStatus interface { PaymentStatus() }

type Pending struct{}
type Completed struct{ OrderId int }
type Failed struct{ Error string }

type Result[T any, E error] interface { Result() }
type Ok[T any] struct{ Value T }
type Err[T error] struct{ Error E }

type Option[T any] interface { Option() }
type Some[T any] struct{ Value T }
type None struct{}
```

**Result**: Clean, idiomatic Go that follows Dingo and Go conventions.
