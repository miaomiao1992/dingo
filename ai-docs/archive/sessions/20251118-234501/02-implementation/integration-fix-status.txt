# Integration Fix Complete

Status: Success
Root cause: Cache scanner used Go parser on raw .dingo files (preprocessing step missing)
Fixed: Added preprocessing in scanFile(), single-file cache in CLI, cache support in golden tests
Tests: 12/12 passing (8 unit + 4 golden, all code compiles)
Known issues: Duplicate imports and comment stripping (pre-existing generator issues, not related to unqualified imports)
