Task F: Golden Tests for Unqualified Import Inference

Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

Tests Created: 5/5 golden test scenarios (100%)
Unit Tests: 8/8 passing (all processor tests pass)
Integration: 0/5 working (transformations NOT being applied)
Golden Outputs: 0/5 created (blocked by integration issue)

Root Cause: PackageContext creation likely fails silently → Falls back to no-cache mode → UnqualifiedImportProcessor not added to pipeline → No transformations

Evidence:
- ✅ Unit tests pass (processor works in isolation)
- ✅ Compiler builds successfully
- ✅ Transpilation completes without errors
- ❌ No transformations in output (ReadFile stays ReadFile, not os.ReadFile)
- ❌ No imports added to output
- ❌ No .dingo-cache.json file created

Test Files Created:
- /Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/unqualified_import_01_basic.dingo
- /Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/unqualified_import_02_local_function.dingo
- /Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/unqualified_import_03_multiple.dingo
- /Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/unqualified_import_04_mixed.dingo
- /Users/jack/mag/dingo/tests/golden/unqualified_import_05_cross_file/ (package with 2 files)

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Add debug logging to see why PackageContext creation fails
2. Enable verbose mode to see cache operations
3. Test file discovery in tests/golden/ directory
4. Consider simpler single-file cache creation for CLI
