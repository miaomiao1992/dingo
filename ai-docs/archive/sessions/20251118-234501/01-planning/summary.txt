Architecture plan complete for unqualified import inference. Proposed two-tier mapping system: qualified map (existing "os.ReadFile" → "os") + new unqualified map ("ReadFile" → "os"). Implementation creates pkg/preprocessor/stdlib_registry.go with standard library function registry, enhances ImportTracker with dual-lookup logic, and transforms unqualified calls to qualified ones. Conservative ambiguity handling (error on ambiguous functions like "Open"). Estimated 4 days implementation across 3 phases: infrastructure, transformation, testing. 5 design questions identified in gaps.json requiring user decisions on ambiguity strategy, registry scope, local function handling, transformation stage, and error message format.
