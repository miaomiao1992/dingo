AST Pre-Scan Scope: Single File Only

The local function scanner operates on single-file scope - it only detects functions defined in the current .dingo file being transpiled, not other files in the package. This is fast (~10-50ms), simple, and fits Dingo's file-oriented transpilation model. Cross-file false transforms are rare and caught immediately by Go compiler with clear errors. Users can workaround with explicit imports or qualified calls. Package-wide scanning can be added as opt-in enhancement if needed.
