# Phase 5 Tooling Readiness Assessment

## Context

You are assessing the **Dingo programming language** - a meta-language for Go (like TypeScript is to JavaScript).

**Current Status:**
- **Phase 4.1 COMPLETE**: Pattern matching + None inference (57/57 tests passing)
- **Phase 4.2 IN PROGRESS**: Pattern matching enhancements (guards, Swift syntax, tuples)

**What Dingo Does:**
- Transpiles `.dingo` → `.go` files (two-stage: preprocessor + go/parser)
- Provides Result<T,E>, Option<T>, enums, pattern matching, error propagation (`?`)
- Maintains 100% Go ecosystem compatibility
- Needs full IDE support via language server

## Your Mission

Assess **Phase 5 readiness** - the tooling infrastructure needed for Dingo to be production-ready:

### 1. Language Server (dingo-lsp)
**Question:** What's the priority and implementation strategy for a gopls-wrapping LSP?

Evaluate:
- Architecture: gopls proxy vs standalone LSP
- Source map integration requirements
- Feature parity needed (autocomplete, go-to-def, diagnostics, refactoring)
- When to implement (now vs after more language features)
- Complexity estimate and risks

### 2. Build Tool Integration
**Question:** What build tooling does Dingo need?

Evaluate:
- `dingo build` maturity (is it production-ready?)
- Integration with `go build`, `go test`, `go mod`
- File watching for development (`dingo watch`)
- Build caching and incremental compilation
- Multi-module support

### 3. Editor Plugins
**Question:** Which editors to support first, and what's needed?

Evaluate:
- Priority: VS Code, Neovim, GoLand, Emacs, Vim
- LSP vs custom plugin approach
- Syntax highlighting (TextMate grammars, Tree-sitter)
- Debugging integration
- Effort required per editor

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
**Question:** Is current golden test approach sufficient?

Evaluate:
- Golden test maturity (267 tests, 97.8% passing)
- Integration testing needs
- Fuzzing and property-based testing
- Performance benchmarking
- CI/CD requirements

### 5. Documentation Tooling
**Question:** What documentation infrastructure is needed?

Evaluate:
- godoc compatibility for generated `.go` files
- Dingo-specific documentation generator
- API documentation from `.dingo` sources
- Examples and playground
- Migration guides (Go → Dingo)

### 6. Package Management
**Question:** How does Dingo integrate with Go modules?

Evaluate:
- Publishing `.dingo` packages
- Consuming `.dingo` dependencies
- Vendoring strategy
- Monorepo support
- Version compatibility

### 7. Developer Experience Tools
**Question:** What QOL tools are critical for adoption?

Evaluate:
- Code formatters (`dingo fmt`)
- Linters (`dingo lint`)
- Migration tools (Go → Dingo converter)
- REPL/playground
- Error message quality

### 8. Debugging Support
**Question:** How to debug Dingo code effectively?

Evaluate:
- Source map integration with delve
- Breakpoint mapping (.dingo line → .go line)
- Variable inspection in Dingo syntax
- Stack trace translation
- Performance profiling

## Your Deliverable

Provide a **prioritized Phase 5 roadmap** with:

1. **Critical Path Items** (must have for v1.0)
2. **High Priority** (needed for adoption)
3. **Medium Priority** (nice to have for v1.0)
4. **Low Priority** (post-v1.0)

For each item:
- **Effort estimate** (person-weeks)
- **Complexity** (Low/Medium/High)
- **Dependencies** (what must be done first)
- **Risk factors** (what could go wrong)
- **Implementation approach** (brief strategy)

## Reference Information

**Dingo Architecture:**
- Two-stage transpilation (preprocessor → go/parser → AST plugins)
- Plugin pipeline: Discovery → Transform → Inject
- Source maps for position mapping (.dingo ↔ .go)
- No runtime library (pure Go code generation)

**Precedents:**
- **TypeScript**: tsc compiler + tsserver LSP
- **templ**: gopls proxy architecture
- **Borgo**: Rust-like syntax → Go transpiler
- **Elm**: Compiler with great error messages

**Current Tooling:**
- `dingo build` - Transpiler (working)
- Golden tests - 267 tests, 97.8% passing
- No LSP yet
- No editor plugins yet
- Basic error reporting
