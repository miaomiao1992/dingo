## Key Recommendations (Consensus from 4 Models)

### Top 5 Actions

1. ✅ **Fix tests NOW** - Blocking everything
2. ✅ **Validate source maps** - LSP depends on this
3. ✅ **Start LSP immediately** - Longest pole, highest priority
4. ✅ **Parallelize aggressively** - 3x speedup with proper team
5. ✅ **Make package mgmt decision** - Enables ecosystem planning

### Strategic Priorities

- **"Time to productive: <10 minutes"** - Success metric (Grok)
- **"Every week delayed is adoption lost"** - Urgency (Grok)
- **"Sourcemaps are the lynchpin"** - Critical dependency (Gemini)
- **"Start debugging NOW"** - Highest complexity (MiniMax)
- **"Sequence for visible wins"** - LSP → VS Code → Adoption (GPT-5.1)
