# Phase 5 Tooling Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary

Dingo's tooling is **significantly more mature than expected**, with several production-ready components already in place. The LSP is fully functional as a gopls proxy, the transpiler has comprehensive features, and the VS Code extension is production-grade. However, **critical gaps exist in debugging, package management, and developer tools** that prevent full production readiness.

**Biggest Gaps:**
1. **Debugging support** - No delve integration or source map debugging
2. **Package management** - No .dingo publishing/consumption strategy  
3. **Developer tools** - No formatter, linter, or playground
4. **2 failing golden tests** blocking quality gate

**Recommended Focus:** Address debugging + package management first to achieve v1.0, then prioritize developer experience tools for rapid adoption.

## Critical Path (Must Have for v1.0)

### 1. **Debugging Support (Delve Integration)**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Effort:** 6-8 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** High
- **Dependencies:** Source maps working, LSP stable
- **Current State:** 0% implemented (no delve, no source map debugging)
- **Risks:** 
  - Delve has no source map support - needs custom integration
  - Position translation must be 100% accurate
  - Race conditions in .dingo ↔ .go position mapping
- **Approach:** 
  - Add `debug` subcommand to dingo CLI
  - Integrate with Delve API (not CLI) for better control
  - Implement source map position translation in Delve
  - Map .dingo breakpoints to .go via source maps
- **Rationale:** Without debugging, developers won't adopt v1.0

### 2. **Package Management Strategy**
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Effort:** 4-6 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)
- **Current State:** 0% - no strategy defined
- **Risks:**
  - Go modules don't support .dingo source
  - Need to choose: Transpile-on-publish vs .dingo-as-dependency
  - Versioning conflicts between .dingo and generated .go
- **Approach:**
  - Define: `.dingo` packages published to go.mod as virtual dependencies
  - Transpile-on-publish: `dingo publish` → creates .go package
  - Consumers use: `go get` → downloads .go, ignores .dingo
  - Alternative: Support .dingo in go.mod with version constraints
- **Rationale:** Undefined package strategy blocks ecosystem growth

### 3. **Fix Golden Test Failures**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Effort:** 1-2 person-weeks  
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Current State:** 2 tests failing (error_prop_02_multiple, option_02_literals)
- **Approach:** Debug failing tests, fix transpiler issues
- **Rationale:** Quality gate for v1.0 (currently 267/269 tests pass)

---

## High Priority

### 4. **Code Formatter (`dingo fmt`)**
- **Priority:** High
- **Effort:** 3-4 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Current State:** 0% (mentioned but not implemented)
- **Approach:** 
  - Use go/parser → format → print via go/printer
  - Format Dingo-specific syntax (type annotations, error propagation)
  - Style guide alignment with go fmt
- **Rationale:** Required for IDE integration and professional use

### 5. **Linter (`dingo lint`)**
- **Priority:** High
- **Effort:** 4-5 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** Medium  
- **Current State:** 0%
- **Approach:**
  - AST-based rule engine (like golangci-lint)
  - Rules: unused variables, nil checks, error handling patterns
  - Editor integration via LSP diagnostics
- **Rationale:** v1.0 quality standard

### 6. **Go ←→ Dingo Migration Tool**
- **Priority:** High
- **Effort:** 3-4 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Current State:** 0%
- **Approach:**
  - `dingo convert --to-dingo` - Converts Go error patterns to Dingo
  - Converts `(T, error)` → `Result<T,E>`
  - Adds type annotations: `var x: Type` → `x: Type`
  - Adds `?` operators where appropriate
- **Rationale:** Lower adoption barrier by automating migration

### 7. **Playground/REPL**
- **Priority:** High  
- **Effort:** 5-6 person-weeks
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Current State:** 0%
- **Approach:**
  - Web-based playground (like Go's playground)
  - REPL for interactive development
  - Syntax highlighting, error messages
- **Rationale:** Critical for adoption (like TypeScript playground)

## Medium Priority

### 8. **Editor Plugin Expansion**
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Effort:** 8-10 person-weeks  
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Current State:** VS Code ✅, Vim/Neovim/Emacs ⏳
- **Approach:**
  - Neovim: Tree-sitter grammar + nvim-lspconfig
  - Vim: LSP client + syntax files
  - Emacs: Major mode + lsp-mode
- **Rationale:** Broader developer reach

### 9. **godoc Compatibility**
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Effort:** 2-3 person-weeks  
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Current State:** 0% (no docs on generated .go files)
- **Approach:** Include godoc comments in transpilation
- **Rationale:** Documentation integration

### 10. **Performance Benchmarking**
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Effort:** 2-3 person-weeks
- **Current State:** 0% (no benchmarks found)
- **Approach:** Benchmark transpilation speed, memory usage
- **Rationale:** v1.0 quality standard

---

## Low Priority (Post-v1.0)

### 11. **Vendor Strategy** (Low)
- **Priority:** Low
- **Effort:** 2-3 person-weeks
- **Current State:** 0%
- **Approach:** Support for `dingo vendor` command

### 12. **CI/CD Integration** (Low)  
- **Current State:** ❌ No CI/CD found
- **Approach:** GitHub Actions/GitLab CI templates

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Months 1-2 (Critical Path):**
- Week 1-2: Fix golden test failures  
- Week 3-6: Debugging support (delve integration)
- Week 7-10: Package management strategy + implementation

**Months 3-4 (High Priority):**
- Month 3: Formatter + linter
- Month 4: Migration tool + playground

**Months 5-6 (Medium/Low Priority):**
- Month 5: Editor expansion + godoc
- Month 6: Performance + CI/CD

## Key Recommendations

**Top 3 Immediate Actions:**

1. **Start debugging support NOW** - 6-8 weeks, highest complexity, unblockable
2. **Define package management strategy** - 4-6 weeks, enables ecosystem  
3. **Fix 2 failing golden tests** - 1-2 weeks, quality gate for v1.0

**Parallelize Where Possible:**
- Formatter + linter development can overlap
- Neovim + Vim plugins can be built simultaneously
- Package strategy work can happen during transpiler implementation

**Precedent-Based Approach:**
- TypeScript's `tsserver` + VS Code = gopls proxy + VS Code extension
- Elm's compiler + editor integration = dingo CLI + Playground
- Borgo's Rust-to-Go = Migration tool patterns

**Success Metrics:**
- Debugger working with source maps
- Package strategy published  
- 267/267 golden tests passing
- VS Code, Neovim, Emacs plugins complete
