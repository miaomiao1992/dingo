[claudish] Model: openai/gpt-4o

To evaluate the Dingo enum naming schemes A/B/C/D for Go idiomaticity, follow these steps manually based on the provided CLAUDE.md instructions:

1. **Session Preparation**:
   - Create a new session folder within `ai-docs/sessions/`.

2. **Multi-Model Consultation**:
   - Use `claudish` to run consultations with external models on each of the six questions. You'll need to prepare prompts for each question separately.

3. **Manual Aggregation**:
   - Once you receive the responses, manually aggregate the insights from the models.
   - Format the final JSON output with the necessary fields.

If you need specific `claudish` command syntax or any other assistance, feel free to ask!
