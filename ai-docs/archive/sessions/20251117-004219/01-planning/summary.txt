ARCHITECTURAL PLAN SUMMARY

Designed complete implementation strategy for four new Dingo features: null safety operator (?.), null coalescing (??), ternary operator (? :), and lambda functions. All features leverage existing plugin architecture and AST infrastructure, with well-defined precedence rules to disambiguate the three uses of '?' in the language. Implementation follows a phased approach: Week 1 focuses on simpler operators (?? and ternary), Week 2 implements safe navigation with chaining, Week 3 adds Rust-style lambdas with type inference, and Week 4 handles integration testing and polish. Total estimated timeline is 3-4 weeks with zero runtime overhead as all features transpile to idiomatic Go code.
