# User Request

Implement the following operators and syntax features for Dingo:

## Operators & Syntax:
- 🔜 Null Safety (`?.`)
- 🔜 Null Coalescing (`??`)
- 🔜 Ternary Operator (`? :`)
- 🔜 Lambda Functions

## Important Context:
- There are couple of parallel dev sessions happening, but this should be isolated
- No backward compatibility needed as there were no releases
- Keep everything simple and clean, drop outdated implementations
- Do not write progress files, update the changelog file if needed
