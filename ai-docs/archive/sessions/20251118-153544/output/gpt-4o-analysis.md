# Parser Architecture Investigation Summary

**Top Recommendation**: Hybrid Approach - Combines the simplicity of preprocessing for basic transformations with the depth of a full parser for complex tasks, ensuring precision and flexibility.

**Key Insight**: Maintaining a robust parsing logic that evolves alongside Go provides flexibility and reduces dependency risks, leveraging both native and third-party tool advantages.

**Biggest Risk/Concern**: Managing dependency complexity and ensuring alignment with ongoing Go updates to prevent divergence.
