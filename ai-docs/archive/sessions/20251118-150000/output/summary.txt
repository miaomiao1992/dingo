Context-aware preprocessing will use a hybrid marker plus sidecar strategy that keeps regex preprocessors lightweight while supplying rich metadata to go/parser plugins. A new context builder records scopes, bindings, and feature annotations, synchronizing them with sourcemap v2 for precise LSP mapping. Plugins will load this metadata to drive pattern matching, smarter `?` propagation, and go/types-assisted validation with <5% performance overhead. Migration proceeds in phased rollout, starting with infrastructure, then feature adoption, while monitoring success via golden tests and IDE accuracy metrics.
