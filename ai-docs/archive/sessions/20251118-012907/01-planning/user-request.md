# User Request: Fix Test Compilation Errors

**Context:**
- Previous session (20251117-233209) successfully implemented Fix A2 and Fix A3
- Commit 7675185 pushed to main with Result<T,E> constructor transformations
- Core implementation is complete and reviewed (75% approval rate)
- Test suite now has compilation errors due to API changes

**Current Test Failures:**
```
tests/error_propagation_test.go:139:17: undefined: builtin.NewErrorPropagationPlugin
tests/error_propagation_test.go:144:14: Logger interface mismatch
tests/error_propagation_test.go:231:23: undefined: builtin.NewTypeInference
tests/error_propagation_test.go:276:26: undefined: builtin.StatementLifter
tests/golden_test.go:75:29: undefined: builtin.NewErrorPropagationPlugin
tests/golden_test.go:76:19: registry.Register undefined
tests/golden_test.go:79:30: undefined: builtin.NewSumTypesPlugin
```

**User Request:**
"let's proceed with next steps"

**Interpretation:**
Fix the test compilation errors to get the test suite passing again, then determine the actual next development phase (likely Phase 3 - Result/Option Integration or the next priority feature).

**Goals:**
1. Fix all test compilation errors in `tests/` directory
2. Update tests to use the new APIs from the refactored plugins
3. Get test suite back to passing state
4. Then identify and plan the next feature development phase

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Broken tests block all future development
