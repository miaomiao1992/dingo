The previous refactoring (commit 7675185) removed old plugin factory functions and changed the plugin architecture, causing 7 compilation errors across tests/error_propagation_test.go and tests/golden_test.go. The main issues are: (1) obsolete factory functions like NewErrorPropagationPlugin() replaced by NewResultTypePlugin(), (2) Logger interface signature mismatch for Info/Error methods, (3) removed Registry.Register() method, and (4) Transform method signature changed from Transform(ctx, file) to Transform(node). The fix requires updating tests to use the new APIs, removing tests for internal components like StatementLifter, and resolving 6 critical architectural questions about plugin lifecycle, generator integration, and intended public API surface.
