[... full context document pasted here from the user message ...]
You are a systems programmer expert in Rust Cargo and Go tooling. Analyze the context. Focus on: 1) Cargo-like workspace analogies for multi-repo Dingo (transpiler + LSP), 2) Build artifact management (binaries, source maps), 3) LSP source mapping challenges in multi-repo setup. Recommend robust, Cargo-inspired organization with exact commands for building/testing across repos.
