STATUS: CHANGES_NEEDED
CRITICAL_COUNT: 8
IMPORTANT_COUNT: 12
MINOR_COUNT: 7

BLOCKING ISSUES:
1. Parser does not create ErrorPropagationExpr nodes (line 404-419 in participle.go)
2. Parser never tracks Dingo nodes in file.DingoNodes map
3. Hardcoded import paths prevent compilation
4. Transformation returns BlockStmt in expression context (type mismatch)
5. Zero value generation uses invalid placeholder
6. Source map VLQ encoding not implemented (empty mappings)

SUMMARY:
Excellent architectural foundation with sound design decisions, but critical implementation gaps prevent core functionality from working. Parser detects `?` operator but doesn't create the AST nodes that transformation expects. Test will fail. Source maps are non-functional. Code will not compile due to placeholder imports.

RECOMMENDATION:
Fix critical parser bugs and import paths before integration. Estimated 2-3 days of work to make functional. Architecture is solid and maintainable once implementation is completed.

STRENGTHS:
- Clean package structure and separation of concerns
- Smart hybrid AST approach (extending go/ast)
- Well-designed plugin system with dependency management
- Comprehensive documentation
- Good error handling and validation

MUST FIX BEFORE INTEGRATION:
1. Parser: Create ErrorPropagationExpr nodes in convertPostfix()
2. Parser: Track Dingo nodes via file.AddDingoNode()
3. All files: Replace "github.com/yourusername/dingo" with actual module path
4. Plugin: Resolve expression/statement context issue
5. Plugin: Implement or document zero value limitation
6. Add integration test that verifies generated Go code compiles and runs
