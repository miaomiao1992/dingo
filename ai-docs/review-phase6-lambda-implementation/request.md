# Code Review Task: Phase 6 Lambda Functions Implementation

## Investigation Target
Conduct a comprehensive code review of the Phase 6 Lambda Functions implementation for the Dingo transpiler project.

## Context
- Working Directory: /Users/jack/mag/dingo
- Current Phase: Phase 6 - Lambda Functions
- Project Type: Go transpiler (meta-language for Go)
- Architecture: Two-stage transpilation (preprocessor + go/parser)

## Review Scope - Files to Analyze

### Primary Implementation Files:
1. **pkg/preprocessor/lambda.go** (641 lines)
   - Balanced delimiter tracking implementation
   - Dual syntax support (TypeScript `=>`, Rust `|params|`)
   - Configuration-driven behavior
   - Handling of single expr, block bodies, type inference, closing braces

2. **pkg/plugin/builtin/lambda_type_inference.go** (337 lines)
   - go/types integration for parameter type inference
   - Context-aware inference logic
   - Function parameters, return values, variable assignments handling
   - Fallback to explicit types mechanism

3. **pkg/config/config.go** (361 lines)
   - Configuration system design
   - File format support (.dingo.yaml, .dingo.yml, .dingo.json)
   - Environment variable overrides
   - Default behavior

### Test Files:
4. **pkg/preprocessor/lambda_test.go** - Unit tests for lambda processing
5. **pkg/config/config_test.go** - Configuration tests
6. **tests/golden/lambda_*.dingo** - Golden test files (lambda_01 through lambda_10)

## Review Criteria

### 1. Code Quality & Production Readiness
- Clean, structured, maintainable code
- Proper error handling and edge case coverage
- Sufficient test coverage
- Potential bugs or issues

### 2. Architecture & Design
- Two-stage approach soundness (preprocessor + go/types)
- Configuration system design quality
- Appropriate abstractions
- Extensibility for future enhancements

### 3. Go Best Practices
- Idiomatic Go conventions
- Proper error handling
- Standard library usage
- Performance considerations

### 4. Dingo Project Principles
- Zero runtime overhead
- Full Go ecosystem compatibility
- Readable generated code
- Source map support

### 5. Testing & Reliability
- Edge case coverage
- Test suite comprehensiveness
- Missing test scenarios
- Error reporting clarity

## Investigation Steps

1. **Read and analyze each primary file**:
   - Read complete file content
   - Understand implementation details
   - Note key functions and their purposes
   - Identify architectural patterns

2. **Review test coverage**:
   - Examine unit tests
   - Review golden tests
   - Check edge case coverage
   - Identify missing test scenarios

3. **Architecture assessment**:
   - Evaluate two-stage approach implementation
   - Review plugin system integration
   - Check configuration system design
   - Assess extensibility

4. **Code quality evaluation**:
   - Check Go best practices compliance
   - Review error handling approach
   - Evaluate code organization and structure
   - Identify potential bugs or issues

5. **Production readiness assessment**:
   - Review code maintainability
   - Check documentation and comments
   - Evaluate performance considerations
   - Assess error reporting quality

## Deliverable Requirements

Write comprehensive review findings to: **ai-docs/review-phase6-lambda-implementation.md**

The review should include:

### Structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - Overall assessment (2-3 sentences)
2. **File-by-File Analysis** with line references for:
   - Key strengths identified
   - Concerns found (with priority levels: Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Specific code examples with line numbers
3. **Architecture Review** - Design quality assessment
4. **Testing Assessment** - Coverage and reliability evaluation
5. **Overall Recommendations** - Actionable improvement suggestions

### Content Requirements:
- **Strengths**: What works well, good practices observed
- **Concerns**: Real issues with file:line references
- **Questions**: Design decisions requiring clarification
- **Recommendations**: Concrete suggestions with examples

### Focus Areas:
- Be thorough but constructive
- Point out real issues while acknowledging good work
- Provide specific file:line references for all concerns
- Give concrete recommendations with code examples
- Consider broader Dingo project context

## Success Criteria
- All primary files thoroughly analyzed
- Specific line numbers referenced for all findings
- Clear categorization of concerns by priority
- Actionable recommendations provided
- Output saved to specified location
